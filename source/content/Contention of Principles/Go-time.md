When an combat encounter suggests a quantity of opponents based on the number of player characters (e.g. \[PC+2\] Robbers), companions such as a Familiar, Flaming Servant, or Patron Saint should be counted among the characters. This also pertains to longstanding NPCs who are effectively members of the adventuring party, so long as they are equipped to affect the outcome of the fight.

When go-time begins, the character with the highest Agility can choose to either act first or to wait. You may choose to place your acting precedence later in the turn order, but once the acting order is established it cannot be changed. If two characters have the same Agility value, then compare Vigilance. If they still share the same value, determine it randomly with an appropriate roll.

Combat With Weapons Ready
When go-time combat begins, it is important to know whether the actors have their weapons drawn or not. Also, remember that Long weapons get a Free Attack against one enemy during the first `turn? round?` of melee go-time, provided that the enemy does not have a Long weapon as well.

Surprise
It usually requires a successful \[Subtlety←Vigilance\] test to surprise someone. If a group tries to surprise another group, instead of individual against individual, use the attackers' lowest Subtlety modified by the defenders’ highest Vigilance. They who surprises an enemy is allowed to make one Free Attack against the enemy at the start of the turn. After that, follow the regular acting order, based on the actors' Agility values, as described above. If any of the combatants are surprised at the start of combat, they must draw their weapons. All Short weapons can be unsheathed as a Free Action. To unsheathe a weapon is otherwise considered a Movement Action. Another option is of course to not draw any weapons and instead choose to use unarmed attacks; an individual's or creature's natural weapons are always considered ready.

Actions in Go-time

In go-time combat, your character will kick and fight, slash and stab, parry and dodge. The character does this with their two Actions per turn; one Combat Action and one Movement Action. The Combat Action can be replaced with an additional Movement Action, and Movement Actions can be replaced by other kinds of Actions.
Besides Combat and Movement Actions, every actor may perform Reactive Actions, such as performing Free Attacks and Defense tests. There are also Free Actions, Actions that are either brief or can be made in parallel with other Actions. All Actions, except Reactions, are performed on the character’s Initiative. Reactions are performed as it sounds, as a reaction to an enemy’s Action or other circumstances.

Combat Action
The most important Action that can be performed in a turn is the attack. It is with this Action that you character attacks its enemies and attempts to harm them with its weapon. The attack is preferably performed with an Active ability, if your character masters such a skill. Passive abilities always act together with active ones.
The attack is made with \[Exactitude←Defense\]. Note that some abilities can allow you to attack using other Attributes besides Exactitude, and calculate Defense using something else than Agility.
A Combat Action does not have to be an attack. To provide first aid to someone or to use any other active ability also counts as a Combat Action.
A Combat Action can be replaced with an additional Movement Action, but not the opposite: a Movement Action cannot be replaced with an additional Combat Action.

Movement Action
The Movement Action represents a meaningful movement in go-time. The Movement Action is done on a character’s acting precedence. Normally, the exact distance is not of any great importance. What does matter in combat is who can make a melee attack and who can use ranged attacks. If a more exact distance needs to be calculated, then a Movement Action represents 10 paces (10 meters), but characters who engage an enemy in melee combat naturally stop by the enemy if the distance is shorter than that (in other words, the character does not have to move the full 10 paces). Movement Actions are used to:
* Reach an enemy and engage it in melee combat.
* Take up a flanking position next to an enemy already fighting an ally.
* Move past an enemy to reach another one that stands further away (enemies that are bypassed may perform a Free Attack).
* Withdraw from melee combat (which allows the enemy to perform a Free Attack against the character). If fighting multiple enemies, then each enemy is allowed a Free Attack.
* Create a clear line of sight to an obscured enemy. Instead of moving, the Movement Action can be used to perform other kinds of Actions:
* Switch weapons
* Stand up from a prone position (requires an Agility test).
* Drink/apply an elixir to yourself.

Reactions
Reactions are quick responses or follow-ups to other Actions or circumstances. They can be performed at any time during the turn and are not tied to the character’s Initiative. The character can perform as many Reactions as is called for per turn, as long as there are triggers to react to. Reactions can use the effect of passive abilities, but not of active ones. free attaCk There are situations when your character will have the opportunity to make a Free Attack with their weapon. This most commonly happens when the character is armed with a Long weapon, when an enemy tries to flee from an ongoing melee combat or when an opponent tries to run past the character in order to reach someone or something behind it. There are also some abilities which trigger Free Attacks under special circumstances. Free attacks can use the effect of passive abilities but not of active ones, and normally the character can only gain one Free Attack per triggering factor and turn – if two enemies try to withdraw from melee only 1 Free Attack is gained, but if one withdraws and one runs past, the character gains one Free Attack on each.
