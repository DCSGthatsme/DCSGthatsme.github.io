Heed was a village with a small creek running through. It was overseen by the chieftain, Sthuna. Responsible for stories was the chronicler, Yaku. When the nearby hamlet of Scarp came under attack, many of the tribe found refuge in Heed.

Every year, Heed holds a Festival of Dousing. Traditionally, the folk of Heed cap off their festivities ritual wherein a great bonfire is lit and everyone forms a human chain from the creek to the fire, working together to douse it. The custom originated from a legend describing the tribe's origin: heroes fend off a serpentine Principle and its creatures long enough to light a bonfire to summon the aid of a moth-like Principle.

With Heed's militia on assignment, Sthuna sent summons for help to liberate Scarp from Principles. The [[Party|party]] is all who came to help and they were successful in their goal. However, they returned to a destroyed Heed and no survivors. By tracking footprints, they caught up with members of the [[Ardent Hearts]] who say they encountered Heed's militia on assignment. They returned as a group to Heed, but only Hearts survived the journey. They took the survivors, 5 in number from both Heed and Scarp, to [[River Nadi]]. There, they built a raft for the survivors to go to [[Accord]].
