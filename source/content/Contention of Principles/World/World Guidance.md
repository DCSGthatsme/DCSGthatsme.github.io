Below are various topics that I felt should be addressed as things that are easy for player and Game Master alike to assume or take for granted. Note that realism is a stylistic choice which is not being adopted for this game. So even though the game contains themes of consequence, some real-world inspirations, and other things commonly attributed to realism, make no mistake; herein lies the *fantasy*.
## Tribalism, Chiefdom, Villagehood
I have opted to use the term "tribe" to refer to social groups, "chief" or "chieftain" to refer to a recognized leader of a tribe, and "village" or "hamlet" to refer to a tribe's settlement (depending on its size). These words may evoke a more specific notion that what is intended due to real-world culture and biases. I encourage you to begin with the aforementioned definitions and allow each term to develop its meaning through engagement with these resources and through play.
## Social Order
In this world, leadership is held by chieftains. Figures like elders and artisans may be held in higher regard, but power is typically earned through reputation and personal action, even for chieftains. How tribes select their chieftains and what other structures support their leadership varies from tribe to tribe. There is no order higher than chiefdom.
## Cultural Identity
Bloodline is rarely considered in matters of kinship and belonging. Ties to a tribe are earned by contribution to and participation in its community. "Family" is typically used only to refer to ancestors, siblings, and descendants. However, kinship (what one in the real world might call "familial") extends readily in this world to any tribespeople who participate actively in one's life. "Race" would be a foreign concept to the people of this world.
## Societal Norms
In this world, no culture uses phenotype to form their expectations for a person or to appraise their worth.
## Conflict Between Humans
At the most brutal, tribes may despise other tribes, and such is rare. The average intercultural exchange looks like misunderstanding but with the desire to reach an understanding. Conflicts like wars or other kinds of mass savageries are unheard of and truly inconceivable to the people of this world. None of this is to say that there are no bad individuals and never any heinous acts committed by a human against a human, but such individuals are rare. Additionally, power disparity between individuals is somewhat uncommon and is rarely so great to abused on a large scale.
## Economics
Commerce is conducted through bartering, the exchange of things and/or services with another. Currency would be a foreign concept to the people of this world. While still rare and beautiful, precious metals and gems are generally not considered to be stores of great value. Food and assistance are always valued, so a person looking to go around and receive valuable things from others ought to carry around storable foods and/or be willing and able to perform odd jobs. Commerce is not as systemic or prevalent as one might expect. Trade between tribes is uncommon and patently risky; the Principles present many dangers.
## Linguistics
It is understood that all humans speak the same language. There is linguistic variation between tribes, what one might call differing dialects. Language also still plays a small role in human culture. However, the idea that humans could "speak different languages from one another" would be a foreign notion to the people of this world. Thus, the language of the world is not titled. Figurative speech, paralanguage, and code are linguistic ideas that are prevalent and understood.

Literacy, however, is not universal. While everyone speaks the same language, not everyone has taken the time to acquire the skill to read and/or write. Thus, written records are not very common, so many tribes use art and oral tradition to perpetuate their stories.
## Religion
Religion, as we understand it, would be a foreign concept to the people of this world. There may be reverence toward Principles or toward human leaders, but such reverence does not cross into belief. Stories and fiction are certainly still very large aspects of human culture, so legend and myth may exist in ways that do not contradict the previous statements.
## Technology
The available technology is mostly primitive, by our standards. I am no historian, so please don't rationalize it in terms of a certain era of real-world history; perceiving something as anachronistic would assuredly become commonplace.

Things are illuminated via flame. Metallurgy and other kinds of artisanry exist and are greatly valued. Agriculture and animal husbandry are common. [Simple machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_machine) are commonly understood and used. Man-made roads and bridges are rare. Gunpowder, electricity, automata, and pneumatics would be foreign concepts to the people of this world.

Innovations tend to be pragmatic and rarely is luxury an objective. Artisans are always innovating their crafts, improving efficiency and adapting to availability.
## Magic
`who can do/ does do magic, how magic is perceived, impermanence, magic not integrated in society`
## Geography
`approx as big as France`
