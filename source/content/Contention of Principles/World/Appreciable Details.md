Below are various topics that I felt should be addressed as things that are easy for player and GM alike to assume or take for granted. Note that "realism" is a stylistic choice which is *not* being adopted for this game. So even though my intentions for this game involve themes of consequence, aspects of our human history, and many other things some people describe as hallmarks of realism, make no mistake; herein lies the *fantasy*.
## Conflict Between Humans
At its most brutal, tribes may despise other tribes. Even that is fairly uncommon. The average intercultural exchange looks like superficial misunderstanding but with the desire to reach an understanding. Mass savageries perpetrated by humans against humans are unheard of and truly inconceivable to the people of this world. This is certainly *not* to say that there are no bad individuals and never any heinous acts committed by a human against a human. Such individuals are uncommon and more rare still would such a person have the kind of power disparity to abuse on such a large scale.
## Social Order
In this world, leadership is held by chieftains. Other figures like elders, artisans, and even respected warriors may be held in higher regard, but power is typically earned through reputation and personal action, even for chieftains. How tribes select their chieftains and what other structures support their leadership varies from tribe to tribe.
## Cultural Identity
Bloodline is rarely considered in matters of kinship and belonging. Ties to a tribe are earned by contribution to and participation in its community. "Family" is typically used only to refer to ancestors, siblings, and descendants. Kinship that *we* might call "familial" extends broadly in this world, including any tribespeople that are active participants in one's life. "Race" would be a foreign concept to the people of this world.
## Social Roles
No culture uses phenotype to form their expectations for a person or to appraise their worth.
## Economics
Commerce is conducted through bartering, the exchange of things and/or services with another. Currency would be a foreign concept to the people of this world. While still rare and beautiful, precious metals or gems are generally not considered to be stores of great value. Food and assistance are always valued, so a person looking to go around and receive value from others ought to carry around storable foods and/or be willing and able to perform odd jobs.
## Linguistics
It is understood that all humans speak the same language. There is linguistic variation between tribes, what one might call differing dialects. Language also still plays a small role in human culture. However, the idea that humans could "speak different languages from one another" would be a foreign notion to the people of this world. Thus, this language is not titled. Figurative speech, paralanguage, and code are linguistic ideas that are prevalent and understood.

Literacy, however, is not universal. While everyone speaks the same language, not everyone has taken the time to acquire the skill to read and/or write. Thus, written records are not very common, so many tribes use art and oral tradition to perpetuate their stories.
## Religion
Religion, as we understand it, would be a foreign concept to the people of this world. There may be reverence toward Principles or toward human leaders, but such reverence does not cross into the realm of faith-based belief. Stories and fiction are certainly still monumental aspects of human culture, so legend and myth does still exist in ways that do not contradict the setting.
## Technology
The available technology is mostly primitive, by our standards. I am no history expert, so don't rationalize it as being on par with a certain era of our history if you can't handle what you would perceive as anachronisms. I can say that electricity and pneumatics don't exist. The notion of an automaton would be a foreign concept to the people of this world. Things are illuminated using flames. Metallurgy is fairly advanced and greatly valued. Gunpowder does not exist.

Things are crafted from locally available materials.

Innovations tend to be pragmatic and rarely is luxury an objective.
## Magic
`who can do/ does do magic, how magic is perceived, impermanence, magic not integrated in society`
## Tribalism, Chiefdom, and Primitivism
I have opted to use the term "tribe" to refer to all social divisions, "chief" to refer to all tribal leaders, and "village" and "hamlet" to refer to settlements.
## Geography
`approx as big as France`
