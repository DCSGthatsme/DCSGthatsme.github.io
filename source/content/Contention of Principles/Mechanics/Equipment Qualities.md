## Balanced
The weapon is so well balanced that it is extra effective when parrying. The weapon provides +1 in Defense.
## Blunt
The weapon lacks either cutting or piercing abilities, and therefore uses one (1) Effect Die lower than other weapons of its kind. The quarterstaff, a Long weapon with the Blunt quality, deals 1D6 damage instead of 1D8, which is the usual damage for long weapons.
## Cumbersome
It is difficult to move around in this armor and its Impeding effect is therefore one point higher than usual; a Cumbersome light armor has a penalty of (−3), a medium of (−4) and a heavy of (−5).
## Deep Impact
The weapon has qualities that makes it even more deadly. Maybe its blade can pierce armor more easily or the weapon itself is so massive that it gets extra crushing power. Either way, the weapon deals +1 extra damage.
## Flexible
The armor is unusually flexible and is less Impeding than its protective capability would suggest. For this reason a Flexible light armor has no penalty at all on Defense tests, sneaking and the use of mystic powers. A Flexible medium armor has a (−1) penalty and a Flexible heavy armor (−2). A Flexible shield can be carried strapped to the arm, ready to use, while at the same time allowing the bearer to use both hands for wielding a Long or Heavy weapon. Even ranged weapons can be used without problem together with a Flexible shield.
## Impeding
The armor hampers any agile movements and gives a penalty to tests against Defense, sneaking and the use of mystic powers. The penalty depends on whether the armor is light (−2), medium (−3) or heavy (−4).
## Jointed
The weapon is jointed, letting the head of the weapon strike past or around blocking weapons or shields, making it harder to parry. The length of the chain also makes the attacks difficult to evade. Even if a parry is successful, the attack hits if the die lands on an odd number; in which case the weapon deals 1D6 damage. This secondary damage is not affected by any abilities – it remains 1D6 regardless of the attacker’s other abilities.
## Long
The weapon has the advantage of superior length and reach, giving the wielder one Free Attack each turn against an opponent that comes into range of melee combat, as long as said opponent is not also armed with a Long weapon.
## Precise
The weapon is designed to be easy to wield and therefore gives +1 to attack tests.
## Short
The weapon can be drawn as a Free Action and can be used with the Feint ability.
