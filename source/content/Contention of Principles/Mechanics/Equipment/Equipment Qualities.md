## Area Effect
`APG`
The weapon affects all inside its area. One test is made for each creature in the area; those who are fail suffer full damage while those who pass the Defense test suffer half damage. Ongoing secondary effects only affect those who suffer full damage from the initial effect. There are two types of Area Effects, radius and cone, and the former exist in two versions: Melee Range and Short. Melee Range Radius: 1–2 meters, meaning one creature and all others in its direct vicinity – those who are in melee combat with the target or who could be without having to spend a movement action. Short Radius: 10 meters, meaning all who are within a movement action from the targeted spot on the ground. Cone: Anyone present in front of the weapon is at risk of being hit when the weapon is fired. If movement by scale is used on a grid, the cone is as wide as the distance from the weapon. At melee range it is 1–2 meters wide, at short range it is approximately 10 meters wide, and at the maximum medium range it is about 20 meters wide.
## Balanced
The weapon is so well balanced that it is extra effective when parrying. The weapon provides +1 in Defense.
## Bastard Weapon
`APG`
The weapon can be wielded in one or two hands, even if it only comes into its own when both hands are resting on the grip. The bastard weapon loses one or all of its qualities when used single-handed, but can instead be combined with a shield, which may be preferable at times. Another upside is that it can be used while on horseback, wielded in one hand until the rider dismounts and can grip it in two.
## Blood-Letting
`APG`
The weapon causes wounds, open or internal, that bleed at a rate of 1 Toughness per turn. The bleeding starts on the turn after a damaging hit and the effect is cumulative: additional damaging hits increase the blood-letting effect by +1. First aid or other kinds of healing will stop the bleeding.
## Blunt
The weapon lacks either cutting or piercing abilities, and therefore uses one (1) Effect Die lower than other weapons of its kind. The quarterstaff, a Long weapon with the Blunt quality, deals 1D6 damage instead of 1D8, which is the usual damage for long weapons.
## Concealed
`APG`
The item normally goes unnoticed, or is seen as something else than a protection or a weapon. If someone actively examines the owner/carrier, a test against \[Subtlety←Vigilance\] is rolled, otherwise it cannot be discovered. Other hidden items can be discovered at first glance with such a test.
## Cumbersome
It is difficult to move around in this armor and its Impeding effect is therefore one point higher than usual; a Cumbersome light armor has a penalty of (−3), a medium of (−4) and a heavy of (−5).
## Deep Impact
The weapon has qualities that makes it even more deadly. Maybe its blade can pierce armor more easily or the weapon itself is so massive that it gets extra crushing power. Either way, the weapon deals +1 extra damage.
## Ensnaring
`APG`
The weapon can be used to snare a target, which is done with a passed \[Exactitude←Agility\] test. An ensnared target cannot move and gets a second chance to fail all success tests. Every attempt to get free requires spending a combat action; this forces the attacker to test \[Exactitude←Agility\] again in order to keep the target in check. Ensnaring melee weapons can be used to try to knock a target prone. The attempt counts as a combat action and requires a passed \[Might←Might\] to succeed. A fallen target cannot get up until it has been freed from the ensnaring effect. Also, note that an Ensnaring weapon may be used with the ability Ensnare to perform more advanced maneuvers (see page 64).
## Flexible
The armor is unusually flexible and is less Impeding than its protective capability would suggest. For this reason a Flexible light armor has no penalty at all on Defense tests, sneaking and the use of mystic powers. A Flexible medium armor has a (−1) penalty and a Flexible heavy armor (−2). A Flexible shield can be carried strapped to the arm, ready to use, while at the same time allowing the bearer to use both hands for wielding a Long or Heavy weapon. Even ranged weapons can be used without problem together with a Flexible shield.
## Impeding
The armor hampers any agile movements and gives a penalty to tests against Defense, sneaking and the use of mystic powers. The penalty depends on whether the armor is light (−2), medium (−3), or heavy (−4).
## Jointed
The weapon is jointed, letting the head of the weapon strike past or around blocking weapons or shields, making it harder to parry. The length of the chain also makes the attacks difficult to evade. Even if a parry is successful, the attack hits if the die lands on an odd number; in which case the weapon deals 1D6 damage. This secondary damage is not affected by any abilities – it remains 1D6 regardless of the attacker's other abilities.
## Long
The weapon has the advantage of superior length and reach, giving the wielder one Free Attack each turn against an opponent that comes into range of melee combat, as long as said opponent is not also armed with a Long weapon.
## Massive
`APG`
The weapon makes other weapons look puny in comparison. The wielder has a second chance at the damage test; the damage die is rolled twice and the higher of the two outcomes is used. Note that this only applies to the damage die of the weapon, not of additional dice from abilities, powers, and elixirs.

If a Massive weapon is used against a player character, the player instead rolls the armor die twice and the lowest value determines the level of protection.
## Precise
The weapon is designed to be easy to wield and therefore gives +1 to attack tests.
## Reinforced
`APG`
The armor is tougher than other armor in the same category (light, medium, heavy), meaning that the wearer may add +1 to their armor rolls.
## Returning
`APG`
The weapon is designed in a way so that a skilled user can make it return if an attack misses the target. A passed Exactitude test is required, which counts as a free action.
## Screening
`APG`
The shield is so big that it completely obstructs the line of sight in one direction; archers must move sideways to get a clear line of sight. An ally walking directly behind the carrier of the Screening shield receives the same protection as the carrier.
## Short
The weapon can be drawn as a Free Action and can be used with the Feint ability.
## Unwieldy
`APG`
The weapon is heavy or unbalanced in a way which makes it more difficult to swing and control during combat. An attack with the weapon requires a full turn; both the combat action and movement action are spent on the attack. In other words, the wielder cannot both attack and move during a single turn, but once they are in place it is possible to make an attack every turn.
## Wrecking
`APG`
The weapon is primarily meant to attack buildings, rather than living creatures; its lack of precision makes it all but impossible to aim at individual enemies, leaving it better suited for shots at fortifications or large areas on the battlefield. Its effect on buildings is considerable and multiple hits will likely wreck the structure – a tower collapses, a wall is breached, a gate is blown open to give the attackers a chance to storm the building. Creatures who happen to be where a Wrecking weapon hits take damage; Armor is ignored but a passed Defense test halves the damage. Anyone present in or on a building which is destroyed dies or becomes dying if they fail a Defense test; if the test is passed, they suffer damage instead, ignoring Armor. Furthermore, the individual is buried in the rubble and it takes the rest of the scene to get out of the wreckage.

## Mystical Qualities
`APG`
## Acid Coated
Each hit from an Acid Coated weapon is potentially corrosive. Each hit with the weapon deals 1d4 extra damage for 1d4 turns. The acidic effect is not added to the normal damage; it is rolled as a separate hit. Such a weapon is often carried in a special sheath or socket to avoid damaging the owner. In combat, the acid will affect the wielder if the attack roll is 20 and a consecutive roll is higher than the wielders Exactitude (or the attribute replacing Exactitude in attacks).
## Assenting
`previously Hallowed`
The item has extra power against corrupt creatures. A creature that is wounded with an Assenting weapon must roll 1d20 over its total corruption value, or suffer +1d4 damage. When someone wearing Assenting armor is hit by a successful attack, the attacker must roll 1d20 over its total corruption value; if the outcome is equal to or lower, the armor adds +1d4 protection against the attack. Thoroughly corrupt creatures always fail these tests, while beings with zero corruption always pass.
## Bane Weapon
The weapon is forged in hate and hardened with vengeance, aimed at a specific group of creatures. The Bane Weapon deals +1d4 damage against members of the selected group and also glows softly in their presence, giving a +1 bonus to Vigilance when testing to discover that such a creature is in the vicinity.
## Dissenting
`previously Desecrated`
The weapon or armor has extra power against untainted creatures. A creature that is wounded with a Dissenting weapon must roll 1d20 under its total corruption value or suffer +1d4 damage. And when someone wearing Dissenting armor is hit by a successful attack, the attacker must roll 1d20 under its total corruption value; if the outcome is equal to or higher, the armor adds +1d4 protection against the attack. Thoroughly corrupt creatures always pass these tests, while untainted beings (with zero corruption) always fail.
## Flaming
The weapon glows and even sparks before bursting into flames when actively used. The weapon deals damage as usual, but the target starts to burn – dealing 1d4 damage for 1d4 turns, starting the turn after the initial hit. The fire is extinguished if the target uses a whole turn to roll on the ground and passes an Agility test.
## Poison Coated
Each hit from a Poison Coated weapon is potentially poisonous. When an attack damages the target it also suffers 1d4 damage for 1d4 turns from poison.
## Retributive
The armor oozes acid. With each hit in melee combat, the attacker must pass an Agility test. If failed, the attacker is hit by an acid splash that deals 1d4 damage for 1d4 turns.
## Thundering
The weapon is instilled with thunderous energies. Each hit echoes with the powers of lightning and deals 1d8 damage, rolled separately from the normal damage caused by the attack. Abilities do not add to this extra damage effect. If any of the damage from this quality penetrates the armor the target also has to pass a Might test or lose an action because of the force unleashed by the Thundering hit.
