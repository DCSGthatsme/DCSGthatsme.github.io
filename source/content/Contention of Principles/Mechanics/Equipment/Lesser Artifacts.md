## Animal Mask
Moderate<br>Blood wading witches tend to identify with the beasts of the wild, a sentiment embodied by the wearing of animal masks. Every animal mask with mystical properties symbolizes an animal and gives a +1 bonus on an attribute associated with that animal – Agility, Might, Subtlety, Vigilance, or Wit.

## Bark Mask
Moderate<br>Green weaving witches often cover their faces with a mask of bark, as a symbol of their connection to nature. Many of these masks are infused with power and provide one re-roll per scene on a test related to plants and anything growing, for example Thorn Cloak and Entangling Vines. The re-roll may be used for tests to activate such powers or to resist the effect of such powers.

## Burial Shroud
Moderate<br>The spiritualists among the witches often wear a shroud over their head when contacting the spirits of the dead, since this makes the spirits calmer and allows for a deeper connection. A mystic using such an artifact gains a +1 bonus to Resolve in all tests when dealing with spirits – both when trying to control them (as in the power Tormenting Spirits) and when trying to resist the effect of monstrous traits used by spirits, involving the Resolve attribute.

## Death Mask
Moderate<br>The necromancers' aspiration to dominate death has led to the use of hideous death masks that have been infused with power. A death mask gives a +1 bonus on tests for all powers and rituals affecting the intersection between life and death, for instance the power Revenant Strike and the ritual Raise Undead.

## Healing Spider
Weak<br>A small spider figurine which is placed on an open wound, where it quickly covers itself and the wound in a web that heals 1d12 Toughness over the course of a day. The spider cannot heal damage from poison or other internal injuries. When done, the spider creeps up from the wound to be reused on new ones. The one treated by the healing spider suffers one point in temporary corruption.

## Iron Crown
Moderate<br>Demonologists often wear a crown of rusty iron when tearing at the world's fabric. These crowns give a +1 bonus when manipulating the world, as with the mystical powers Exorcize and Teleport, or the ritual Summon Daemon.

## Lucky Coin
Moderate<br>A gold coin instilled with energies of good fortune. The coin is carried in a pocket and gives a +1 bonus to one success test, once per scene. Whoever toys with such energies is at risk of suffering from the opposite effect; if the outcome of a test modified by the coin is 20, the carrier will have bad luck for the rest of the scene – all success tests have a second chance to fail.

## Marlit Cape
Moderate<br>The skin of a marlit, a reptile known for its sneaky hunting style, is treated with preserving alchemical preparations so that it keeps its camouflaging properties after the death of the beast. The wearer has a +1 bonus to Subtlety when sneaking and hiding.

## Meeting Stone
Weak<br>A stone is loaded with an invitation to a specific person, who upon receiving and touching the artifact instinctively knows where the stone's owner is waiting. Only a mystic (with at least one mystical power) can activate a meeting stone.

## Mind Prism
Moderate<br>The illusionists of Ordo Magica often use a prism to describe how the perception of reality may be broken down and understood. Some of these crystals are filled with so much suggestive energies that they provide a +1 bonus to all tests related to the creation of illusions.

## Mystical Focus
Strong<br>A tradition-specific focus gives a +1 bonus on all tests related to all powers of the tradition, but limited to one use per scene. The bonus may be used together with other lesser artifacts that also provide a bonus to success tests for the mystical power in question. A mystical focus is bound to the user as other, higher artifacts – that is, by spending an experience point or by willingly accepting one point in permanent corruption.

Example of Mystical Focus
WITCHCRAFT - Mask made of wood or bone, often painted or adorned with colorful beads
WIZARDRY - Staff carved with power symbols
STAFF MAGIC - Staff head, often a stone entwined in filigree work or held by an ornamental claw
SORCERY - Rod of human bone, engraved with dark runes
SYMBOLISM - A jar filled with air paint
THEURGY - A holy symbol that glows softly in the dark and shines when used
TROLL SINGING - A crumhorn, birch- bark horn or similar instrument that hums or plays quietly even when not used

## Order Medallion
Weak<br>The medallions of Ordo Magica are given to novices and stay with the wizards for their entire career. When the wizard reaches adept level, the medallion transforms to symbolize this step; the same thing happens when reaching master level. Some chapters have made the order medallion mandatory and have also bound certain functions to it, such as the ability to open doors which are closed to outsiders/novices/adepts and to activate the chapter's magic circle.

## Pest Mask
Weak<br>In a world full of contagions and poisons it is no wonder that many methods – effective or only superstitious – have been developed to resist such phenomena. The Confessors of the Sun Church, for instance, carry pest masks to protect themselves. They allow the wearer to use their Resolve instead of Might on tests to resist sicknesses and poisons.

## Ritual Codex
Weak<br>A ritual is penned down in a codex so that another ritualist can perform it without having previously learned the ritual. The codex can only be used once.

## Ritual Focus
Moderate<br>A tradition-specific object which gives a +1 bonus on success tests for all rituals belonging to the tradition. See examples to the right.

Examples of Ritual Focuses
WITCHCRAFT - Clothing in natural fabrics with woven power symbols
WIZARDRY - A collection of metal symbols, where different metals represent different elements or principles
STAFF MAGIC - A staff foot in metal, used to draw symbols on the ground
SORCERY - Chalice shaped like the skull of a daemon, from which sacrificial blood is drunk during the ritual
SYMBOLISM - Rune-carving tools with glowing tips
THEURGY - Shrouding from a lightbringer, carried like a cape or draped over the object of the ritual
TROLL SINGING - Stone tablet, wooden board or bone shield with carved symbols, functioning as a note or song sheet of ancient hymns and powerful rhythms
## Ritual Seal
Strong<br>The artifact crafter binds a ritual to a seal; when broken, the effect of the ritual is triggered. The creator of the seal need not know the ritual, but must be in the company of one who does when it is created (or have access to a ritual codex explaining the ritual; the codex is destroyed with this act). He or she who breaks the seal suffers from temporary corruption as usual.

## Ruler's Ring
Moderate<br>Prominent mind-warping wizards often carry a gold ring on a finger, around the wrist or upper arm, or on the head in the form of a headband. To them, this represents the noble endeavor of the ruler. These rings are often instilled with the ability to dominate all living beings. If so, the gold ring gives a +1 bonus to all test involving powers and rituals of Wizardry affecting the will of the target, for example the use of, and resistance to, Bend Will and Telepathic Interrogation.

## Rune Staff
Strong<br>The hallmark of the staff mage is his or her personal staff, carved with the runes of the elements. In the hand of its owner, the staff emits a protective aura (Armor +1d4), and is also the instrument through which the mage wields his or her powers.

## Soul Stone
Strong<br>A Soul Stone is the item required to perform the ritual with the same name.

## Spark Stone
Moderate<br>The power of a Pyromancer is increased by this glowing amber. The spark stone is a weaker version of the renowned Sun Stones that the master pyromancers of old could craft from summoned fire spirits. Nowadays, the fire wizards have to make do with lesser artifacts, far from as powerful but still a great help to those whose skills relate to fire and burning. All powers with fire effects gain a +1 bonus to the effect die when used by someone with a spark stone in hand or on top of his or her staff.
## Spell Scroll
Artifact crafters in Ordo Magica can bind a mystical power at the novice, adept, or master level (depending on the level of the artifact) to a scroll. The power may then be activated by someone else who has Wizardry at a level equal to or higher than the level of the power, or someone who has the ability [[Loremaster]] at adept level`two levels in`. Whoever activates the scroll suffers temporary corruption as usual and the scroll is spent upon activation.

Weak<br>Imbue a scroll with a Novice Mystical Power.

Moderate<br>Imbue a scroll with an Adept Mystical Power.

Strong<br>Imbue a scroll with a Master Mystical Power.
## Spell Seal
An artifact crafter has bound a mystical power at the novice or adept level to a seal; when the seal is broken, the power is activated. Whoever breaks the seal suffers temporary corruption as usual and the seal is spent when broken.

Moderate<br>Imbue a seal with a Novice Mystical Power.

Strong<br>Imbue a seal with an Adept Mystical Power.
## Staff Foot
Moderate<br>A staff foot forged with strengthening spells can give the staff of a staff mage extra power when used as a weapon. The artifact is attached to the staff and gives a +1 bonus on the effect tests of all melee or ranged attacks, and on all powers which directly use the staff as a weapon. Even if this artifact most often is attached to a rune staff, it may be attached to an ordinary wooden staff with the same effect.

## Staff Head
Moderate<br>A special ornament at the top of the staff mage's staff can provide extra focus. The staff head – often a beautiful stone encased in meteoric iron – gives a +1 bonus to all success tests that do not directly involve the staff as a weapon, as for instance Blood Storm and Sphere.

## Sun Mask
Moderate<br>The sun masks of the theurgs bestow spiritual warmth to the cold-hearted and spread light where no other light can reach. Worn by a theurg, they can also assist in combat against undead and abominations. The mask radiates light around the wearer as if it is a torch; also, all powers with holy or banishing effects have a +1 bonus to effect tests.

## Toad Guard
Weak<br>A figurine in the form of a toad acts as an alarm. The user – who has to know at least one mystical power – whispers a triggering condition to the figurine; the trigger has to be of a physical nature and must occur close to the toad guard, for example that “someone passes through the grove” or “the door is opened from outside.” If activated, the toad will wake everyone with a loud croaking.

## Transcendental Weapon
Strong<br>These weapons were forged to allow a wielder to strike from a distance. Only mystics (defined as someone who has learned at least one mystical power) know how to use such an artifact. The attack is rolled as if in melee combat but may hit distant targets and requires a clear line of sight, just as ranged attacks. Active abilities may be used, but at one level lower: a master may use the adept level of the ability through the transcendental weapon; an adept may use the novice level. A novice cannot use the ability together with a transcendental weapon.

## Witch Braid
Moderate<br>This braid is made from three types of hair or fur and keeps death at bay, giving a +1 bonus to Might during death tests. Non-player characters with the braid get to make death tests, with the +1 bonus.
