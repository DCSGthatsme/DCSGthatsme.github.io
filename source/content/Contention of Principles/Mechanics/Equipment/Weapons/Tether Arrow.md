`APG, previously Snaring Arrow`
1d6 damage (when fired from a bow)

A barbed arrowhead and a thin silk thread attached to the arrow make it possible to tether a target using this projectile. Pulling it out takes a Movement Action and requires a passed \[Might –Damage\] test; if successful the target suffers 1d4 damage but the arrow is out.

While a tether arrow is embedded in the target and is still held by the archer:
* Each time the target takes a Movement Action, the tether arrow deals 1 damage, ignoring armor.
* Either the archer or the target may take a Primary Action to tug on the tether. With a successful \[Might←Might\] check, the other is knocked prone.
* The archer may make a \[Might←Might\] check to drag the target along their movement.
