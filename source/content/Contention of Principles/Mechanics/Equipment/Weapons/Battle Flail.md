`renamed from Heavy Flail by APG`
[[Two-handed]], [[Jointed]]<br>1d10 damage

The battle flail is a Jointed weapon, where a metal ball – often spiked – attached to a two-handed shaft by a chain is swung against the enemy. It is not easy to parry a flail since the metal ball often strikes around the parrying weapon or shield to find its target.
 
The battle flail comes in a number of shapes, like the traditional wooden two-handed shaft attached to a chain that ends in a spiked metal head. There are also variants with spiked pieces of metal that are linked together, as well as models where two or three chains and metal heads share the same shaft. Regardless of design, they all share the weight of the flail and the fact that they are difficult to block.
