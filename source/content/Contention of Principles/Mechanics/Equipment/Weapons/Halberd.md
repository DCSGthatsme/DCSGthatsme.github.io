[[Versatile]], [[Long]] (two-handed)<br>1d8+1 damage

The halberd, also known as the pole axe, has elements of both the Long and the Heavy weapon since it is combining the point of a spear with the head of an axe. It cannot thrust as quickly as the spear, but its sweeping chop can have a devastating effect.
