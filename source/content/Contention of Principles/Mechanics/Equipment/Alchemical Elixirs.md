The peoples of the Davokar region possess a vast knowledge of how to transform the herbs, fruits and bodily organs of nature into useful elixirs. Among the barbarians it is usually the witches who create the elixirs, while Ambrian decoctions are often made by specialized craftsmen and artisans.

The exchange of knowledge between alchemists in Ambria and Davokar causes ever more elixirs to become available to the Ambrians. Some drugs can only be purchased on the black market in places like Thistle Hold, since they are illegal or at least so inappropriate that selling (or buying) them will attract attention from the authorities and witchhunters. Among these are all the elixirs that give corruption; both Ambrians and barbarians handle the trade in such decoctions discreetly. Finding a specific elixir on the black market in Ambria requires a Wit test by someone with the boon Contacts (treasure hunter or some similar specialization).

Weak<br>
Moderate<br>
Strong<br>
# Antidote
Weak<br>A weak antidote lowers the effect of a poison by one degree; a strong poison becomes moderate, a moderate poison becomes weak and a weak poison is completely neutralized. The antidote does not affect any damage that a character has already suffered. Requires a passed Wit test to take effect.

Moderate<br>A moderate antidote lowers the effect of a poison by two degrees; a strong poison becomes weak, while both moderate and weak poisons are completely neutralized. The antidote does not affect any damage that a character has already suffered. Requires a passed Wit test to take effect.

Strong<br>A strong antidote lowers the effect of a poison by three degrees, which usually means that the poison is completely neutralized. The antidote does not affect any damage that a character has already suffered. Requires a passed Wit test to take effect.
# Antidote Candle
`APG`
When lit, this candle emits fumes that work as an antidote on all around it.

Moderate<br>Affects every poisoned creature in the vicinity and reduces the effect of ongoing poisons by one level – a strong poison becomes moderate, a moderate weak and a weak is neutralized.

Strong<br>Does the same, but with a two level reduction: a strong poison becomes weak while moderate and weak ones are neutralized. Note that this does not affect damage already suffered.
# Choking Spores
Moderate<br>Choking Spores are produced from Davokar's lichens and mushrooms. The elixir is used specifically with the Strangler ability.
# Drone Dew
`APG`
Moderate<br>Drone Dew is a liquid elixir made from drone spores, also containing accelerants. A person who ingests a dose of the elixir immediately falls asleep if they do not pass a Might test, and stays asleep for an hour or until suffering any damage. If the test is passed, the person is instead dazed, with the effect that they are limited to one action per turn and cannot use any active abilities for an hour.
# Eye Drops
Moderate<br>These drops will immediately return the gift of sight to a temporarily blinded creature.
# Elemental Essence
Moderate<br>When applying a dose of elemental essence, either one weapon, four throwing weapons, or all the arrows/bolts in a quiver deal, 1D4 elemental damage for the duration of a scene. The alchemist must choose which element to prepare: fire, cold, acid or lightning.
# Elixir of Life
Strong<br>Consuming an Elixir of Life gives the drinker regenerative powers that heal 1D6 points of [[Toughness]] during 1D6 turns, on the character's turns. Sadly, the character also suffers 1 temporary corruption for each turn the elixir is in effect.
# Fire Dye
`APG`
Weak<br>Fire dye consists of salts that change the color of any fire they are cast into. If the colors are ascribed a specific meaning known to the user and an allied observer it can be used for signaling over long distances. They are also used for entertainment among the wealthy, and by charlatans to impress commoners.
# Flash Powder
`APG`
Weak<br>A finely grained powder that emits a blinding light when thrown. Flash Powder is used with the novice level of the ability Pyrotechnics.
# Ghost Candle
Moderate<br>The fumes from this candle make invisible things at a location or in a room visible.
# Herbal Cure
Weak<br>An herbal cure consists of an alchemical poultice coupled with bandages. It smells vile but heals 1 point of [[Toughness]]. The herbal cure has greater effect if used by a character with the Medic ability.
# Holy Water
`APG`
Moderate<br>Holy water, instilled with the light of Prios, can heal wounds and sooth souls. It works as a Herbal Cure with +1 on the effect test (meaning +2 [[Toughness]] if used without the ability Medicus), and it also removes 1 point of temporary corruption.
#  Homing Arrow
`APG`
Weak<br>The alchemist marinates an arrow in homing essences, thereby creating an arrow that flies past other combatants, i.e. it does not require clear line of sight. However, the archer must see some part of the target and must roll a normal attack test in order to successfully hit.
# Homunculus
`APG`
Weak<br>A seed is planted and one day later a miniature servant sprouts from the ground. The homunculus is small as a child, has no abilities and all attribute values are 5 (+5). It serves its maker loyally then withers away after a month; all it leaves behind is a pile of dirt. Creating a homunculus is a true violation of the natural order, meaning that the one using the seed suffers 1d6 temporary corruption.
# Magic Concentrate
Moderate<br>A dose of mystical essence, which gives a mystic a second chance to succeed with a Resolve test the next time they attempt to use a mystical power.
# Poison
Weak<br>A weak poison deals 1D4 damage each turn for 1D4 turns.

Moderate<br>A moderate poison deals 1D6 damage each turn for 1D6 turns.

Strong<br>A strong poison deals 1D8 damage each turn for 1D8 turns.
# Poison Candle
`APG`
A seemingly ordinary candle that emits poisonous fumes when lit; revealed with a passed \[Vigilance←alchemist's Subtlety\]. The poison is airborne and affects everyone in the room or in the vicinity. The candle must burn for 1d4 turns before the poison is released, so the assassin can light it and leave the room before it takes effect.

Moderate<br>Deals 2 damage per turn

Strong<br>3 damage per turn
# Protective Oil
Moderate<br>The alchemical oil protects against elemental damage by providing +1D4 [[Protection]] against one of the elements for the duration of a scene. The alchemist must choose which of the elements that the oil shields against: fire, cold, acid or lightning.
# Purple Sap
`APG`
The Purple Sap is made from a decoction of a purple Lily of the Valley, a flower whose cleansing proper- ties and resistance to corruption were discovered by the witches of Davokar long ago. Purchasing the elixir is expensive, because the ingredient is so rare and few alchemists are skilled enough to brew it. The elixir has no effect on permanent corruption or on blight-marks which have already appeared on the user.

Weak<br>A novice alchemist can brew a potion which immediately removes 1d4 temporary corruption from the user's soul.

Moderate<br>When made by an adept, the elixir immediately removes 1d6 temporary corruption.

Strong<br>The master's version removes 1d8 temporary corruption.
# Revealing Light
`APG`
Weak<br>A wax candle that when lit makes living creatures (not undead or abominations) glow softly in the dark, making it harder to stay hidden (a second chance to fail tests for sneaking up on someone, or a second chance to pass tests to discover someone sneaking). This affects everyone in the room or the vicinity, including the one who lit the candle.
# Shadow Tint
`APG`
Moderate<br>This horribly sickening elixir was once used by mystics wanting to hide just how close they were to becoming thoroughly corrupt, making it a welcomed addition to all sorcerers' collections of mystical decoctions. Whomever manages to force down the sludge, distorts their shadow for a whole scene, making it appear as if the value in total corruption is 1d6 points lower.
# Smoke Bomb
`APG`
Moderate<br>The smoke bomb is a ceramic vessel that emits dense alchemical smoke when crushed, and it is used with the adept level of the ability Pyrotechnics. The smoke fills a room or covers a group of people engaged in melee combat.
# Spirit Friend
`APG`
Strong<br>The miraculous drug called Spirit Friend is cooked in a cauldron, but it is not the liquid that is bottled, but the vapors. The gray-white smoke is captured in small ceramic jars and inhaled when needed. Spirit Friend gives the user level I in the trait Spirit Form. The effect lasts for 1d4 turns, to the price of as many points in temporary corruption.
# Spore Bomb
Strong<br>The spore bomb is used together with the Strangler ability.
# Stun Bolt
`APG`
Weak<br>The alchemist covers a crossbow bolt in a fast acting muscle relaxant; anyone hit by the bolt must pass a \[Might -Damage\] test or fall to the ground. The monstrous trait Robust gives +2 in Might per level when rolling this test.
# Thorn Beasties
`APG`
Moderate<br>A handful of seeds are thrown to the ground and one turn later 1d4 thorn beasties appear to serve the user. The thorn beasties are small, vaguely humanoid creatures made of thorns; they do not speak but squeak and crack as twigs that are bent and rubbed together. The beasties live during a single scene before drying up to look like thorny dolls. The summoning of the thorn beasties is a clear violation of the natural order, meaning that the one using the seeds suffers 1d6 temporary corruption.

Thorn BeasTy Manner Rustling and crackling Race Creeper Traits Natural Weapon (I), Poisonous (I) Exactitude 13 (–3), Wit 10 (0), Subtlety 11 (–1), Charisma 5 (+5), Agility 15 (–5), Resolve 9 (+1), Might 7 (+3), Vigilance 10 (0) Abilities None Weapons Razor sharp thorns 3 Armor None Defense –5 Toughness 10 Pain Threshold 3 Equipment None Shadow Same as the mystic Tactics: Moves lightning fast with jerky motions towards the appointed goal or task.
# Thunder Ball
`APG`
Strong<br>An alchemical load that is thrown and detonates amidst a sudden, loud flash, used with the master level of the ability Pyrotechnics.
# Transforming Draught
`APG`
This is a powerful mutagen which transforms the body of the user in a monstrous way. During a scene the user is twisted into a bestial half-creature and has a second chance to fail all Charisma tests until the effect wears off. The draught gives the user a monstrous trait for the rest of the scene; the level of the trait is decided by the strength of the elixir. In addition, each dose consumed deals temporary corruption, also determined by the strength of the elixir. Of course, the physical transformation and the corrupting effect is reason enough for the elixir to be banned and only available on Ambria's black market.

The following monstrous traits can be acquired, decided by the alchemist when brewing the elixir: Armored, Natural Weapon, Robust and Wings.

Weak<br>The draught gives the selected trait at level I, to the cost of 1d4 temporary corruption.

Moderate<br>The draught gives the selected trait at level II, to the cost of 1d6 temporary corruption.

Strong<br>The draught gives the selected trait at level III, to the cost of 1d8 temporary corruption.
# Twilight Tincture
`APG`
Strong<br>This is an extract of dried stems and leaves from the extremely rare Twilight Thistle. Up until recently, the rareness of the herb (on occasion, one or a couple of stems can be found among other offerings in the ruins of Davokar, rather than an actual growing site) coupled with its moderate medical effect made it not very sought-after; it seems to have an effect on certain types of eczema and possibly also on senility if consumed. However, with the aging of the queen mother has come an increased demand from the court. Of course, the tale of how Lasifor Nightpitch bought the land on which Thistle Hold is built for an armful of Twilight Thistles gave the herb a hefty boost in popularity among fortune hunters. Lately, the twilight tincture has found another group of users, and a new area of use: it has proven capable of disguising a number of symptoms gained from being undead. Desperate unfortunates – some of them alchemists – searched for ways to hide their death marks, and someone discovered that the twilight tincture (consumed, not smeared on the skin) temporarily made an undead body come to life: the skin regained its redness, the body temperature rose, and the smell of the breath improved dramatically. The effect lasts for a week per passed \[Might –permanent corruption\] test. If the test fails, the effect lingers for one more day before dissipating completely. On thoroughly corrupt creatures the effect only lasts for a day per dose, no test is made.
# War Paint
`APG`
Weak<br>Mystically charged paints can help a warrior in combat. War paint adds +1 to either Agility or Might during an entire scene, and the warrior decides which attribute to boost when the paint is applied.
# Waybread
Weak<br>One loaf of this rich waybread corresponds to a week's food supply for one person.
# Wild Chew
`APG`
Weak<br>The red chewing resin called Wild Chew is a strong stimulant that makes the chewer more alert, less cautious and much more aggressive. One dose of Wild Chew moves 2 points in Subtlety, Wit, and Resolve to Agility, Might and Exactitude for the rest of the scene. During the upcoming scene, the user feels weak and has -2 on all attributes. With time, Wild Chew is highly addictive and severe withdrawal symptoms will occur unless the user consumes one dose each week, with the risk of permanent madness or death. No known drugs can counteract this.
# Wraith Dust
Strong<br>The wraith dust forces an incorporeal being (a creature with the monstrous trait Spirit Form) to take physical form for the duration of a scene. The dust must be thrown with a \[Exactitude←Defense\] test; if hit the spirit takes damage as living creatures do.
