## Mystical Qualities
## Acid Coated
`APG`
Each hit from an Acid Coated weapon is potentially corrosive. Each hit with the weapon deals 1d4 extra damage for 1d4 turns. The acidic effect is not added to the normal damage; it is rolled as a separate hit. Such a weapon is often carried in a special sheath or socket to avoid damaging the owner. In combat, the acid will affect the wielder if the attack roll is 20 and a consecutive roll is higher than the wielders [[Exactitude]] (or the attribute replacing Exactitude in attacks).
## Assenting
`APG`
`previously Hallowed`
The item has extra power against corrupt creatures. A creature that is wounded with an Assenting weapon must roll 1d20 over its total [[Corruption]] value, or suffer +1d4 damage. When someone wearing Assenting armor is hit by a successful attack, the attacker must roll 1d20 over its total Corruption value; if the outcome is equal to or lower, the armor adds +1d4 protection against the attack. Thoroughly corrupt creatures always fail these tests, while beings with zero Corruption always pass.
## Bane Weapon
`APG`
The weapon is forged in hate and hardened with vengeance, aimed at a specific group of creatures. The Bane Weapon deals +1d4 damage against members of the selected group and also glows softly in their presence, giving a +1 bonus to [[Vigilance]] when testing to discover that such a creature is in the vicinity.
## Dissenting
`APG`
`previously Desecrated`
The weapon or armor has extra power against untainted creatures. A creature that is wounded with a Dissenting weapon must roll 1d20 under its total [[Corruption]] value or suffer +1d4 damage. And when someone wearing Dissenting armor is hit by a successful attack, the attacker must roll 1d20 under its total Corruption value; if the outcome is equal to or higher, the armor adds +1d4 protection against the attack. Thoroughly corrupt creatures always pass these tests, while untainted beings (with zero Corruption) always fail.
## Flaming
`APG`
The weapon glows and even sparks before bursting into flames when actively used. The weapon deals damage as usual, but the target starts to burn â€“ dealing 1d4 damage for 1d4 turns, starting the turn after the initial hit. The fire is extinguished if the target uses a whole turn to roll on the ground and passes an Agility test.
## Poison Coated
`APG`
Each hit from a Poison Coated weapon is potentially poisonous. When an attack damages the target it also suffers 1d4 damage for 1d4 turns from poison.
## Retributive
`APG`
The armor oozes acid. With each hit in melee combat, the attacker must pass an [[Agility]] test. If failed, the attacker is hit by an acid splash that deals 1d4 damage for 1d4 turns.
## Thundering
`APG`
The weapon is instilled with thunderous energies. Each hit echoes with the powers of lightning and deals 1d8 damage, rolled separately from the normal damage caused by the attack. Abilities do not add to this extra damage effect. If any of the damage from this quality penetrates the armor the target also has to pass a [[Might]] test or lose an action because of the force unleashed by the Thundering hit.
