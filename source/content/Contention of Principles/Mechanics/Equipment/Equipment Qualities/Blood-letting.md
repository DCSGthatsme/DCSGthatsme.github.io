## Effect
If the target of this weapon takes damage from an attack, the weapon causes wounds that bleed at a rate of 1 [[Toughness]] per turn. The bleeding starts on the turn after a damaging hit and the effect is cumulative: additional damaging hits increase the blood-letting effect by +1. First aid or other kinds of healing will stop the bleeding.
