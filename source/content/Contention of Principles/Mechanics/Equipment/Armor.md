Each suit of armor provides a certain amount of [[Protection]], indicated by a specific die. Some armor also has qualities that affect how the armor works mechanically. Just like weapons, different cultures have developed a number of diverse kinds of armor, all with their respective advantages and disadvantages.

## Light Armor
Light armor is easy to come by and does not limit the wearer's capabilities substantially in acrobatic situations or when performing stealthy maneuvers. Yet it has a negative effect when using mystical powers. Hardened, ring and studded leather are all examples of light armor.
### Padded Robes
+1d4 [[Protection]]
### Fur Armor
+1d4 [[Protection]]<br>[[Impeding]] (-3)
## Medium Armor
Medium armor offers better protection than the light versions but at the cost of being more restrictive to the wearer's movements. However, this downside is considered an acceptable trade-off by most melee combatants. Scale- and chainmail are examples of medium armor.
### Leather Armor
+1d6 [[Protection]]<br>[[Impeding]] (-1)
### Scale Armor
+1d6 [[Protection]]<br>[[Impeding]] (-4)
## Heavy Armor
Those melee combatants that can afford it usually chose increased protection at the cost of even greater restrictions to their movement. A self-respecting warrior wears chainmail enforced by shoulder, knee, and elbow plates, while those with the means tend to order themselves a personalized set of full plate armor.
### Full Plate Armor
+1d8 [[Protection]]<br>[[Impeding]] (-2)

Personalized full plate armor is available for those of sufficient means, and offers the best protection available with less restriction than many other kinds of heavy armor.
