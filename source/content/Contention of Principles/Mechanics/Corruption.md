As the bow flexes back to shape with the force to launch an arrow, so too does the world jerk to equilibrium with a retaliatory intensity when warped. Such times when nature is put to its limits, the transgressor accrues Corruption. Characters begin life with no Corruption, but through meddlement in magic ([[Mystical Powers]], [[Rituals]], etc.), characters can incur Corruption. Needless to say, Corruption can be a brutal detriment, as it results in [[Stigmas]] of varying horror.

There are two classes of Corruption: **Temporary Corruption** and **Permanent Corruption**. A character's **Total Corruption** is their Permanent + Temporary.

Temporary Corruption fades away by itself at the end of the scene. However, Permanent Corruption is a lasting stain on the character's essence and inner being.

When a character incurs Corruption that exceeds their [[Corruption Tolerance]] in a single instance, they receive a Minor Stigma.

A character is **Corrupted** if their Total Corruption surpasses their [[Corruption Limit]]. While a character is Corrupted, they incur one additional point (+1) of Permanent Corruption whenever they incur an instance of Corruption (applies to the instance that puts them past their Limit). Additionally, their Corruption Tolerance is equal to 0. At the end of the scene (before Temporary Corruption subsides), if they are still Corrupted, they will receive a Major Stigma.

A fate worse than death surely awaits a character whose Permanent Corruption alone exceeds their Corruption Limit.
