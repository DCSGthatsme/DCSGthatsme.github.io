Magic in this world stems from the principles. The power is out there, and it need only be sought and its corruption withstood. Though this corruption is an unavoidable effect to men who engage with true magic, men who are guided toward the source of their power may suffer less. There are four ways a man may be bonded to principle magics: Appreciation, Captivation, Exaltation, and Fear.

Adept

Master
`A dense fog of boiling shadow seems to seep from the master fearful mystic; the onerous immensity of imperfection and injustice harries the world through the mystic.`
Special. Each time the fearful mystic attempts to affect the Resolve attribute of another creature, they may choose to roll against the creature's Shadow instead (the creatures Resolve â€“Total Corruption). Thoroughly corrupted creatures are strangely immune to this; it is as if they feed off the darkness of the world to carry on with their dark calling.
