## Agility
Agility represents a character's reflexes, balance, nimbleness, and how fleet-footed they are. It determines their acting precedence during go-time and is used actively when jumping, avoiding harm, and performing similar athletic maneuvers. Agility is often opposed by an enemy's Exactitude.
## Charisma
Charisma reflects how well a character can influence interpret others in the realm of words, emotion, paralanguage, and presentation of character. It is often used when trying to persuade another to do (or refrain from doing) something, whether verbally or otherwise. Charisma is usually opposed by an enemy's Resolve.
## Exactitude
A character's hand-eye coordination, finesse, precision, and timing are all represented by Exactitude. It is used to hit an intended target with punches, strikes, throws, or a projectile. Exactitude is most often opposed by an enemy's Agility.
## Resolve
Resolve represents a character's mental fortitude, whether in resistance to outside influences or in their own willpower. Resolve is tied to the use of mystical powers and the endurance of [[Corruption]]. The Attribute is often opposed by an enemy's Resolve or Charisma. Note that having a very low value in this Attribute is inadvisable because of the risk for Corruption.
## Might
Might represents a character's capacity to use their physical strength in order to, for instance, lift something heavy or break down a door. It also covers the capacity to withstand physical damage and to resist poisons and diseases. Might is usually modified by a level of Difficulty, sometimes by an enemy's Might.
## Subtlety
A character's Subtlety represents their aptitude for and training in being silent, dexterous, and discreet. It can be used to avoid detection of oneself or one's actions. Subtlety is often opposed by an enemy's Vigilance.
## Vigilance
Vigilance represents a character's general awareness; the attunement of their senses and their ability to detect the details of their surroundings. Vigilance is often opposed by an enemy's Subtlety.
## Wit
Wit represents a character's knowledge, cunning, common sense, and education. It is used when trying to recall facts, problem solving, or seeking truth when the information is laid bare. Wit is usually tested against a specific level of Difficulty, decided by the Game Master.
## Secondary Attributes
The following statistics are calculated based on the character's Attributes:
* Toughness = Might (or 10 if Might is less than 10)
* Pain Threshold = Might/2 (rounded up)
* Defense = Agility - Armor's Impedance
* Corruption Threshold = Resolve/2 (rounded up)
* `?Exactitude = (Agility + Subtlety)/2 (rounded up)`
* `?Resolve = (Might + Wit)/2 (rounded up)`
