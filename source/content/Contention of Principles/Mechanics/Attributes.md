## Agility
Agility represents a character’s reflexes, balance, nimbleness, and how fleet-footed they are. It determines the order of action during incidences and is used actively when jumping, avoiding harm, and performing similar athletic maneuvers. Agility is often opposed by an enemy’s Exactitude.
## Charisma
Charisma reflects how well a player character can influence `and interpret?` others in the realm of words, emotion, paralanguage, and presentation of character. The Attribute is often used when trying to persuade another to do (or refrain from doing) something, whether verbally or otherwise. Charisma is usually opposed by an enemy’s Resolve.
## Exactitude
A character’s hand-eye coordination, finesse, precision, and timing are all represented by Exactitude. For instance, this Attribute is used to hit an intended target with punches, strikes, throws, or a missile from a ranged weapon. Exactitude is in most cases opposed by an enemy’s Agility.
## Resolve
Resolve represents a character’s mental fortitude, whether in resistance to outside influences or in their own willpower. Resolve is tied to the use of mystical powers and the endurance of Corruption. The Attribute is often opposed by either an enemy’s Resolve or Charisma. Note that having a very low value in this Attribute is inadvisable, because of the risk for Corruption.
## Might
Might mirrors a character’s capacity to use their physical strength in order to, for instance, lift something heavy or break down a door. It also covers the capacity to withstand physical damage and to resist poisons and diseases. Might is usually modified by a level of Difficulty, sometimes by an enemy’s Might.
## Subtlety
A player character’s value in Subtlety mirrors their aptitude for and training in being silent, dexterous, and discreet. This Attribute can be used to avoid detection of oneself or one's actions. Subtlety is often opposed by an enemy’s Vigilance.
## Vigilance
Vigilance represents a character’s general awareness, the attunement of their senses and their ability to detect the details of its surroundings. Vigilance is often opposed by an enemy’s Subtlety.
## Wit
The Wit Attribute represents a character’s knowledge and cunning, their common sense as well as education. You usually test Wit when trying to recall facts, problem solving, or seeking truth when the information is laid bare. Wit is usually tested against a specific level of Difficulty, decided by the Game Master.
## Secondary Attributes
The following statistics are calculated based on the character’s Attributes:
* Toughness = Might (or 10 if Might is less than 10)
* Pain Threshold = Might/2 (rounded up)
* Defense = Agility - Armor’s Impedance
* Corruption Threshold = Resolve/2 (rounded up)
* `?Exactitude = (Agility + Subtlety)/2 (rounded up)`
* `?Resolve = (Might + Wit)/2 (rounded up)`

## Table

| Agility    | Quick      |
| Charisma   | Persuasive |
| Exactitude | Accurate   |
| Resolve    | Resolute   |
| Might      | Strong     |
| Subtlety   | Discreet   |
| Vigilance  | Vigilant   |
| Wit        | Cunning    |
## Notes
* Social scenarios can use many attributes
	* Charisma to influence
	* Subtlety to mask what is potentially visually apparent (still Charisma to lie, even in terms of body language)
	* Vigilance to detect social cues (but still Charisma to interpret them. Think Perception vs Insight)
