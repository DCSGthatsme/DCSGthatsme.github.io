## Effect
The character has served in an organization or traveled far and wide, and has therefore spun a wide web of contacts. With a successful roll against Charisma, the character can call to mind a contact that should be able to help with a specific question or in a precarious situation. The contact may not be available directly â€“ that depends on who is included in the web of contacts.
