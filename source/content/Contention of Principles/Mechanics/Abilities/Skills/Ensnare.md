## Ability
Using weapons like bolas, nets, or the long whip, many fighters and hunters learn to limit the movement of enemies or prey. The character is trained in the ensnaring techniques used to gain [[Advantage]] in melee or to capture prey alive.

Novice<br>Active. The character gains a second chance to ensnare a target (requires a weapon with the quality [[Ensnaring]]).

Adept<br>Active. In addition to the novice effect, the character gains a second chance to bring down an ensnared enemy (requires a weapon with the quality Ensnaring).

Master<br>Reaction. The character's skill with ensnaring weapons is such that every ensnaring attack is assumed to hit the target's neck and have a strangling effect; besides the ensnaring effect and the chance to bring down the enemy, the target suffers 1D6 damage, ignoring [[Toughness]]. If the target reaches 0 [[Health]], the character can choose to make them unconscious instead of Powerless.
