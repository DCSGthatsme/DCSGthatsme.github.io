# Ability
Large weapons rest comfortably in the character's callused hands and can have an astoundingly destructive effect on all sorts of targets.

Novice<br>Passive. The damage dealt by [[Two-handed]] weapons and [[Versatile]] weapons (excluding [[Long]] weapons) used in both hands is increased by one die tier.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character has mastered the use of their weapon, so when an attack misses a target the character may instead use the returning swing in an attempt to hit the target again. The character makes a new attack roll wherein the weapon deals 1D8 damage if successful.

Master<br>Active. A heavy weapon in the hands of a master is truly a tool of armor-crushing destruction. When the two-handed attacks of a master hit the target, they completely ignore the target's [[Toughness]].
