## Ability
The apparent simplicity of the staff tends to mask its versatility as a weapon, which is demonstrated by skilled staff fighters. Staff Fighting may be performed with all Long weapons – staff, spear, halberd, pike, and the more exotic chain staff. Moreover, staff fighting techniques are especially useful for anyone using them with the simplest of all Long weapons – the wooden staff.

Novice<br>Reaction. The character is proficient in parrying incoming attacks and thus gains +1 in [[Defense]] while wielding a staff; with a simple light staff – the quickest and most balanced of the Long weapons – the bonus is +2 in Defense.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character uses the back end of the Long weapon to gain a Free Attack if the opponent defends against the initial attack. The Free Attack is rolled separately and the damage is 1D6. If armed with a simple light staff, this may also be done after every successful Defense against melee attacks while holding the weapon – the staff fighter makes a quick riposte after having parried.

Master<br>Active. The character targets the legs and attacks the fallen enemy in a single motion. The initial attack sends the enemy to the ground if the attacker succeeds with a \[[[Exactitude]]←[[Agility]]\] test and the follow-up is performed as a Free Attack with [[Advantage]] on the opponent.
