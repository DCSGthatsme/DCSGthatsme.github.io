## Ability
The character is familiar with the effective use of poisoned weapons in combat.

The Poisoner ability can be used to identify different poisons or the effect of a poison on a wounded or dead person.

Novice<br>Free. As a Free Action, the character can apply one dose of poison or any other [[Alchemical Substances|Alchemical Substance]] to a weapon. That one dose of poison is enough for one hit with the weapon before more of the poison must be applied. A \[[[Wit]]←[[Might]]\] test is needed for the poison to take effect; if successful the victim starts to take damage. The damage suffered per round and the duration of the poison depends on its strength.

Adept<br>Free. As novice, but the character understands how to make a dose of poison last an entire battle. After applying a dose, all attacks counts as poisonous for the duration of the scene.

Master<br>Free. The character has mastered the art of poisoning and knows how to get the most out of a poison. If the character succeeds with a Wit test, any poison applied to a weapon counts as one level higher than usual. Weak poison counts as Moderate, Moderate counts as Strong. Strong poison does not deal any additional damage but gives the character a second chance to succeed the \[Wit←Might\] test instead.
