## Ability
Only available if [[Exactitude]] + [[Subtlety]] â‰¥ 23

Among fencers, a parrying dagger is regarded as a more reasonable tool for defense than a shield. The character may use their free hand along with a mantle or similar sheet of cloth for defense. When used by the character, the sheet becomes a sweeping and hypnotic shield that can confuse or temporarily blind the opponent.

Novice<br>Passive. The character's mantle, or some similar sheet of cloth held in the hand, gives a +1 bonus to [[Defense]].

Adept<br>Active. The mantle strikes at the enemy's eyes, temporarily blinding the target if the attack roll is successful. The character immediately gains a Free Attack against the target, an attack that the enemy must defend against as if blinded. Everyone attacking the blind target can take advantage of the situation for the duration of the round.

Master<br>Active. In the master's hands, the mantle is like a whip with the quality Ensnaring, making it possible to use it to trap the target.
