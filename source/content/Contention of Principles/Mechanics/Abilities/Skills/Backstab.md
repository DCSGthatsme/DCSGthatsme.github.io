# Ability
The character has learned how to exploit weaknesses in an enemy's defense, and will not let an opportunity go by without making a Backstab.

Novice<br>Reaction. Once per round, the character deals +1D4 damage on an attack made with Advantage (in addition to existing Advantage benefits). The character may use [[Subtlety]] instead of [[Exactitude]] when making attacks while at an Advantage.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character's Backstab deals extra damage (as above) and also causes a bleeding wound to the enemy. The attack opens a wound that bleeds heavily, inflicting 1D4 damage each round following the attack. The enemy continues to bleed until healed in some way.

Master<br>Reaction. The character's Backstab deals 1D8 extra damage and causes a bleeding wound to the enemy, just like at adept level. There are no longer any limits to how many backstabs a Master can perform each round. All attacks are backstabs as long as the conditions for Advantage are met.
