## Ability
Only available if [[Agility]] + [[Might]] > 22

Truly dedicated archers have techniques for rapid firing. If one can master the ability knock, aim, and fire in a single fluid motion, they can launch arrows one after another. This ability requires some kind of bow.

Novice<br>Active. The character can spend their Movement Action to fire a second arrow, two in total. This may only be done if the Primary Action is also used for firing a bow. The dice for the two actions are rolled separately and may (but do not have to) be aimed at the same target.

Adept<br>Active. The character may fire two arrows with a single Primary Action, at one or two different targets.

Master<br>Active. The character fires three arrows with a single combat action, at one or two different targets.
