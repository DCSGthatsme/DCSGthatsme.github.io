The character has learned the art of acrobatic maneuvering. The nimbleness of the acrobat provides an advantage when trying to withdraw from close combat or when wanting to quickly reach the middle of an enemy formation.

Novice<br>Reaction. The character may roll against [[Agility]] to avoid Free Attacks from enemies in melee go-time, either when trying to slip past an enemy or when attempting to withdraw. Should the test fail, the player must choose for their character to either remain in their original place or to move anyway and suffer a Free Attack from the opponent.

Adept<br>Free. If the character is knocked down they may attempt to jump back up again as a Free Action by making a Agility test. If the test fails the character has to spend a Movement Action to get back on their feet, as usual.

Master<br>Reaction. The character can utilize their enemies as shields in battle. In combat with more than one opponent, the character may once per round use an enemy as a shield and have that enemy suffer a successful hit instead of the character. That opponent cannot defend against the attack, but the master acrobat has to make a successful roll against Agility for the enemy to take the hit.
