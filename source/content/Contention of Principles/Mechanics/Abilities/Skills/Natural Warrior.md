## Ability
Weapons are not always available or practical. Through long and hard training, the character has become a dangerous opponent even when unarmed.

Novice<br>Passive. The character has learned to use their natural-born warrior capabilities with great efficiency. The character's attacks with [[Unarmed]] weapons deal one die tier higher of damage. If they also have the [[Natural Weapon]] [[Monstrous Features|Monstrous Feature]], then the damage is further increased according to the level of Natural Weapon.

Adept<br>Active. With the speed of an adept, the character may now perform a double attack with an Unarmed weapon against a single target. The two attacks are rolled separately.

Master<br>Passive. By attacking an opponent's weak points with flawless precision – such as throat and knees – the master's unarmed strikes are truly devastating. Each attack with an Unarmed weapon that hits deals 1D6 extra damage.
