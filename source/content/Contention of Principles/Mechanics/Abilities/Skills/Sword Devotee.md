# Ability
Sword devotees have achieved a certain symbiosis with their swords, handling their weapons as if they were extensions of their body and soul. The sword devotion techniques may only be used with a single-handed sword with an additive [[Defense]] modifier.

Sword Devotee cannot be combined with the ability [[Twin Attack]] to gain additional bonuses to damage.

Novice<br>Passive. The character has learned to take full advantage of fighting with a sword with an additive Defense modifier in one hand and a parrying dagger in the other. While wielding both of such weapons, the damage dealt by the sword is 1D10, instead of 1D8.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character can perform a rapid riposte. After one successful Defense per turn, the character gains a Free Attack against the enemy if they are wielding a sword with additive Defense modifier alongside a parrying dagger.

Master<br>Reaction. The master can perform a series of ripostes and gains a Free Attack against the opponent with each successful Defense test, with no limitation on the number of Free Attacks per turn.<br>
Passive. The master sword devotee also gets 1D12 damage dealt with their swords while they are wielding a sword with an additive Defense modifier alongside a parrying dagger.
