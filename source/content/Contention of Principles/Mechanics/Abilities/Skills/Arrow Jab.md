## Ability
In the chaos of the battlefield, archers may find themselves dragged into the melee. For such instances, a ranged weapon may need to be used in unorthodox ways.

Novice<br>Reaction. As a Reaction to a melee attack against them, the character can draw an arrow or bolt and use it to stab an enemy. The character must succeed with a normal attack roll against the enemy; a successful hit deals 1D6 damage and any qualities of the projectile are considered.

Adept<br>Reaction. Like the novice level, but 1D8 damage.

Master<br>Reaction. Like the adept level, but the master also gains a Free Attack with the bow if the jab attack hits. The master stabs with the projectile, then (if successful) loads the bow to make a normal ranged attack at the target. If using a crossbow, this requires that it already be loaded and that the initial stab is made with another bolt, or that the character is in possession of a repeating crossbow.
