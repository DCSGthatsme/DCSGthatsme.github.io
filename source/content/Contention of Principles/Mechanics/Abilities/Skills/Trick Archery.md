## Ability
Only available if [[Exactitude]] + [[Wit]] ≥ 23

Trick archers are not many, since most people lack the patience for honing their skills to such an astounding degree. The character is one of few who have dedicated their lives to mastering the bow or the crossbow.

Novice<br>Active. The character can use a Primary Action *and* a Movement Action to aim and perfectly hit a precise location on the enemy. They can shoot a weapon from a hand, nail a body part to a nearby surface, or aim for the eyes to blind the enemy. The attack is rolled as usual and if it hits and deals damage, the intended effect also occurs: a weapon is dropped and must be picked up, an arrow that nails the enemy to a wall must be pulled out or broken, and a hit close to the eyes leaves the enemy temporarily blinded. Whichever the case, the target loses a Primary Action in order to deal with the situation.

Adept<br>Active. The archer can cause projectiles to ricochet off floors, walls, furniture, shields or living creatures with robust skin or armor in order to hit targets behind cover so the character does not need free line of sight before firing. They must have an idea of where the target is or have watched them duck into hiding. If the target made a double Movement Action on its last turn, it cannot be hit. This kind of attack is made as usual, regarding both success test and damage.

Master<br>Reaction. Once per round, the character can parry a successful attack at range. This ranged parrying maneuver can be of two types:
* Versus a melee attack targeting at an ally: The master archer fires a projectile that deflects an attack which otherwise would have hit one of their allies. This parrying maneuver requires a passed \[Exactitude←[[Agility]]\] test; if successful, the attack misses the ally without dealing any damage.
* Versus a physical projectile targeting the archer or an ally: The parrying maneuver requires a passed \[Exactitude←Agility\] test; if successful, the incoming projectile is deflected and misses its target.
