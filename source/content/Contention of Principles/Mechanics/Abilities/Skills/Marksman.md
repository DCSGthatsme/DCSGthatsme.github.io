# Ability
The character can inflict serious damage on their enemies with a projectile weapon, hoping to either bring them down or at least make sure that they do not reach those of the character's allies that are equipped for melee combat.

Novice<br>Passive. Thanks to the character's skill, their damage dealt with projectile weapons is increased by one die tier.

Adept<br>Active. The character's precision grants their projectiles a crippling effect. The attack deals damage as usual and if the target is wounded the character may make an \[[[Exactitude]]‚Üê[[Might]]\] test every time the target attempts to move. A successful test means that the target cannot move and their Movement Action is forfeit. As soon as the target manages to move (the character fails the test), the crippling effect is gone.

Master<br>Active. The master marksman's projectiles become piercing. The shot hits a weak spot and completely ignores the target's [[Protection]].
