# Ability
The character has studied the secrets of the flexible weapons and learned to make full use of their potential.

Novice<br>Passive. In the character's hands, a [[Flexible]] weapon gains the quality [[Ensnaring]], and may therefore be used to ensnare an enemy, instead of making a normal attack. When using an [[Unwieldy]] Flexible weapon, the novice flailer may also make an [[Agility]] check to be able to move as part of the attack.

Adept<br>Passive. The character can put great force into the secondary damage of Flexible weapons; such hits now deal a die tier greater damage.

Master<br>Active. The master flailer can use a Flexible weapon to continue to strike even after having hit a target. The character may perform attacks against all enemies within range of melee; each attack is rolled separately.
