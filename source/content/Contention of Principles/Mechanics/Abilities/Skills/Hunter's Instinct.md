## Ability
Only available if [[Exactitude]] + [[Vigilance]] â‰¥ 23

Hunters have a finely tuned instinct. There are few targets who can avoid a hunter's projectiles.

Novice<br>Special. The hunter appoints a target in sight and gets a second chance to succeed with all ranged attacks against it. The target is appointed when the character makes an attack against it, and the effect lasts until the prey dies or the scene ends.

Adept<br>Passive. The hunter's ranged attacks against an appointed target deal +1D4 damage.

Master<br>Reaction. The master hunter lets no prey escape. The character gets a ranged Free Attack at an appointed target as soon as it moves. This happens every time the target uses a Movement Action to get from one place to another; a target using both actions for movement provokes two ranged Free Attacks from the character.
