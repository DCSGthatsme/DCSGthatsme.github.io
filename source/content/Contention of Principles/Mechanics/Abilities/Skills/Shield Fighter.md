# Ability
The character is trained in how to make good use of a shield, and how to actively fight using the shield as a weapon. Behind the protection of the shield, the character can generate great momentum to fuel their attacks, as well as strike with the shield itself.

The buckler, a kind of light shield usually utilized by archers, is too light to be used with the Shield Fighter ability. The Shield Fighter has to carry a sturdy, weighty shield to deliver the necessary impact.

Novice<br>Passive. The damage dealt by weapons held in the character's sword arm is increased by one die tier (to 1D10 for single-handed weapons or to 1D8 if for a Short weapon). The novice Shield Fighter also wields their shield as an instrument of protection with greater efficiency and therefore receives a +2 [[Defense]] bonus instead of the usual +1 when using a shield.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character has learned how to combine weapon and shield so well that every successful attack may be followed up by a shield bash against the same target (separate attack roll). If it hits, the damage of the shield bash is 1D4, and should the shield fighter make a successful test against \[[[Might]]‚ÜêMight\] the target is also knocked to the ground.

Master<br>Reaction. The damage of the shield bash is increased from 1D4 to 1D8.
