# Ability
Only available if [[Resolve]] + [[Wit]] > 22

The Strong Gift – innate or acquired through trials and practice – can still be found with some mystics. The gift provides a singular resistance against the corruption of the world. It also endows the mystic with the ability to use improvised mystical powers, at a high cost in corruption.

Novice<br>Special. The Strong Gift allows the character to choose a signature power. This power is selected from among the ones already known to the mystic, and that power then only costs one (1) temporary corruption to use. If the character has no powers or just prefers to have a tainting ability as their signature instead, this is also allowed – a gift linked to the ability [[Ritualist]] (including all individual rituals) or to [[Sublime Sight]] means that these never cost more than one temporary corruption to use. Also, traits such as Wisdom of the Ages may be chosen. The Strong Gift has no effect on the cost in permanent corruption for learning a power outside a mystical tradition; it only affects the amount of temporary corruption gained when using it.

Adept<br>Passive. A character with the adept level in Strong Gift uses their whole [[Resolve]] value as the [[Corruption Threshold]], instead of only half. Such an individual does not become blight born until their total corruption reaches a value of Resolve ×2`?`

Master<br>Special. The master may cast ANY *novice* mystical power. When casting powers granted by this ability, the character takes 1D8 Temporary Corruption and must succeed each success test necessitated by the power a second time.
