# Ability
The character knows special self-defense techniques of a more "dirty" variety.

Novice<br>Active. Cheap Shots like a headbutt or nut shot come naturally to the character in stressful situations. Such an attack deals 1D6 damage, and if the opponent is damaged the character also gains a Free Attack against them.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character performs a normal melee attack and if it deals damage, they add a trip or a tackle. Such a maneuver knocks the opponent to the ground if the character succeeds with a \[[[Wit]]‚Üê[[Agility]]\] test.

Master<br>Reaction. Every enemy who engages the character in melee suffers a bloody riposte dealing 1D6 damage directly after their attack. The riposte always hits a weak spot and consequently ignores [[Toughness]].
