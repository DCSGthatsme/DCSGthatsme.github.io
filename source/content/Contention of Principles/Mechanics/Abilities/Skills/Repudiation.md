# Ability
Only available if [[Resolve]] + [[Wit]] > 22

Repudiation provides a singular resistance against [[Corruption]]. It also endows the mystic with the ability to use improvised [[Mystical Powers]], at a high cost in Corruption.

Novice<br>Special. Repudiation allows the mystic to choose a signature [[Abilities|Ability]] among the ones they know. Once per instance in which the mystic uses their signature Ability, they may take 1 temporary Corruption instead of 1D4 temporary Corruption. In the case of [[Ritualist]], all individual [[Rituals]] benefit. The mystic may spend 5 [[Experience]] to change their signature Ability.

Adept<br>Passive. A character with the adept level in Repudiation gets a bonus to their [[Corruption Limit]] equal to their [[Toughness]].

Master<br>Special. The master may cast ANY *novice* mystical power. When casting powers granted by this ability, the character takes 1D8 Temporary Corruption and must succeed each success test necessitated by the power a second time.
