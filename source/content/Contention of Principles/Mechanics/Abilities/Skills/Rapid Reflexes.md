## Ability
Only available if [[Agility]] + [[Vigilance]] â‰¥ 23

Novice<br>Reaction. In situations when the character suffers from an effect which may result in full or half damage, they suffer half damage instead of full and no damage instead of half. As an example, if hit by a [[Brimstone Cascade]] that normally deals 1D12 with a hit and 1D6 with a miss, this is transformed into 1D6 with a hit and no damage at all with a miss.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character avoids the enemy's melee attack and dances around to their back; with a passed [[Defense]] test, the character and the enemy switch places, if the character wishes. This means that the character gets away from being flanked without suffering a Free Attack, and also that the enemy ends up in a flanked position if there was an ally standing next to the character.

Master<br>Free. The character's expert reflexes are so finely tuned that their acting precedence is always first; only others with this ability and a higher value in Agility or Vigilance gets to go before them.
