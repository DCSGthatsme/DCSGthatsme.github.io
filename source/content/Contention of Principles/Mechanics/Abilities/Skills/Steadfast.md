## Ability
The character has a mind as hard as steel, inspiring them to endure even against insurmountable odds. Mystics rarely succeed when trying to hurt or seize control of the character's senses, and sometimes a truly steadfast character manages to defend themself mentally and even redirect the magic back upon the mystical attacker.

Novice<br>Reaction. The character can make a second attempt to succeed with a [[Might]] or [[Resolve]] test when trying to break an ongoing physical effect from, for instance, traps or [[Alchemical Substances]]. This includes energies from mystical powers, as long as these are manifested physically in the forms of fire, acid, or similar.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character is unshakable and can make a second attempt to shrug off ongoing powers that affects either their will or their senses.

Master<br>Reaction. The psyche of the character strikes back against anyone who tries to affect it. Whenever the character is the victim of a mental attack (in other words, those attacks that are modified by Resolve) that fails, the attacker suffers 1D6 damage that ignores [[Toughness]].
