## Ability
Only available if [[Charisma]] + [[Might]] â‰¥ 23

There are many who fight their way to a position of leadership, but there are few who are recognized as true leaders by the people they are meant to lead. If equipped with this ability, the character is an inspiring, charismatic, and eloquent person whom others listen to and follow, sometimes to their death.

The Leader ability can be useful to seize command over a group of strangers, organize a militia and the like.

Novice<br>Passive. Due to their strong personality, the character can use Charisma in place of [[Resolve]], except as a basis for [[Corruption Tolerance]] and [[Corruption Limit]].

Adept<br>Active. The character can nominate a creature or an object to be the focused target of their allies for the duration of a scene. All allies who attack that target inflict 1D4 additional damage with each hit. Changing the target requires a new Primary Action from the Leader.

Master<br>Active. The Leader gives a rousing speech to their allies, allowing each one to use their Charisma instead of their Resolve for the duration of a scene.
