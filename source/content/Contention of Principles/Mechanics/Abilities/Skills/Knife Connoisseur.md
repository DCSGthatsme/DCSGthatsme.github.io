## Ability
A special fighting technique to be employed wherever combat is waged in restricted spaces.

Knife Connoisseur may only be performed with knife-like weapons, i.e. sticking or cutting weapons with the quality [[Short]].

Novice<br>Passive. The character can choose to attack with [[Agility]] instead of [[Exactitude]] when performing a melee attack with a Short, knife-like weapon.

Adept<br>Passive. The character makes two separate knife-attacks at the same target with every Primary Action. If the character also has Twin Attack, this ability only affects one of the attacks, for a total of three attacks (two with the main hand and one with the other).

Master<br>Reaction. The character can fight effectively with a knife at very short range from the enemy: when the character deals damage with a knife-attack, they are assumed to be so close that the enemy has a hard time using ordinary weapons effectively (the character has two chances to pass the [[Defense]] test), and is unable to attack with Long weapons. To reach a better distance, the enemy has toâ€¦

... win the initiative next round (see [[Take the Initiative]]) and then continue attacking until the knife-fighter hits again.

... use a Movement Action to withdraw from melee, and then suffer a Free Attack from the knife-fighter. If the Free Attack deals damage, the enemy once again finds themself at too short of a distance to attack effectively.
