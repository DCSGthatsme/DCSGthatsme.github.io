## Ability
In the chaos of the battlefield, a ranged weapon may need to be used in unorthodox ways.

Novice<br>Reaction. As a Reaction to a melee attack against them, the character can retaliate with a Free Attack using a readied [[Short]] projectile weapon as a melee weapon.

Adept<br>Reaction. As Novice, but such attacks now deal a die tier greater damage.

Master<br>Reaction. As Adept, but if the Master stabs with the projectile and hits, they may make a Free ranged attack at the target using the relevant weapon.
