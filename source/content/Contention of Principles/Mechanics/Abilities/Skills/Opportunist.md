## Ability
In the mid of battle, weak spots become exposed and can be exploited. The character has learned how to make use of such opportunities.

Novice<br>Reaction. The character has a second chance to succeed on Free Attacks gained from the enemy withdrawing from melee.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character may use active abilities on Free Attacks gained from the enemy withdrawing from melee. If used, this cancels out the second chance to succeed granted by the novice level.

Master<br>Reaction. When an enemy withdraws from melee, the master opportunist both gains a second chance to succeed with and is allowed to use active abilities on the Free Attack roll.
