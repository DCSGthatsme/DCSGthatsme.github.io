## Ability
Only available if [[Resolve]] + [[Might]] â‰¥ 23

The warrior's spirit is strengthened in combat, giving them miraculous power when needed. The character is one who has found this source of aggression within, and knows how to make use of it.

Novice<br>Passive. The character can handle taking a beating and considers [[Health|Maximum Health]] as \[Might +5\]. This does not affect [[Pain Tolerance]], which is based on Might/2 as usual.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character grows stronger by suffering damage. When the character's Health is halved, they have a second chance to pass all tests against Might, including attacks rolled against Might.

Master<br>Reaction. The character grows even stronger when severely damaged. When the character's Health is halved, they deal +1D4 melee damage, in addition to the effect mentioned at the adept level.
