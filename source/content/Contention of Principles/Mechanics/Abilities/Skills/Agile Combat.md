## Ability
Only available if [[Agility]] + [[Exactitude]] â‰¥ 23

During combat in wooded areas and hilly terrain the distance between opponents can shift rapidly. The character has developed techniques for quickly handling shifts between weapons, and at their most skilled among can dance through the battlefield, seamlessly alternating between melee and ranged weapons and using every hostile attack for making counter-strikes.

Novice<br>Passive. In go-time, the character can split their movement and perform one part of the Movement Action before the Primary Action, and the other part after. This is done in order to make maximum use of the terrain and cover. The character still suffers Free Attacks from enemies if the movement leads into or through melee distance.

Adept<br>Passive. As a part of their Primary Action, the character may freely switch between weapons. This only pertains to changing weapons; it does not provide an extra action to be used for anything else. For instance, the character may start holding two weapons, move a part of their movement range, and as a Primary Action switch to a bow, fire it, and then switch back to two weapons. Finally, the rest of the movement is made.

Master<br>Reaction. The character gains a second chance to pass all [[Defense]] tests against Free Attacks provoked by withdrawing from melee. In addition, every such Free Attack against the character lets them make their own Free Attack against the enemy. The character may freely switch weapons for these counter-strikes and choose the tool that fits the situation best.
