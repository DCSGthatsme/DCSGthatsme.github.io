# Ability
The character has realized that the creatures of the wild are best combated after having been caught and fettered.

Trained trappers can deploy and disarm both mechanical traps and alchemical mines. Furthermore, when the need arises, the character can quickly manufacture improvised traps from materials at hand.

Novice<br>Active. With a passed [[Wit]] test, the character can use a Primary Action to deploy or disarm a mechanical trap. The character can also build an improvised trap, but this requires a whole turn to complete. An improvised trap made by the character deals 1D6 damage.

Adept<br>Active. The character can handle alchemical mines the same way they handle mechanical traps. An improvised trap made by the character now deals 1D8 damage.

Master<br>Active. The character is a renowned trapper who knows how to utilize any kind of trap. Traps are counted as one tier higher: weak becomes moderate, moderate becomes strong, and strong devices allow the character a second chance on success tests. The enemies' attempts to discover, disarm, or get free become more difficult; the damage dice are rolled twice and the higher outcome stands. For alchemical traps, the damage reroll only pertains to the initial explosion, not the ongoing effects. Improvised traps now deal 1D10 damage.

## Traps
Anyone at risk of activating a trap discovers it with a passed \[Vigilant←Discreet\] test.

A discovered trap can be bypassed in two ways: It can be jumped over as part of a movement action, which requires a \[Quick←Cunning\] test. If the test fails, the trap is sprung and the character is caught by it, i.e. movement is interrupted. If the terrain allows, a trap can always be ignored by going around it. This costs an extra movement action, or more depending on the terrain.

A discovered trap can also be disarmed. An untrained individual cannot disarm traps – they have to incapacitate them by shooting or poking at them with a long instrument (the quality Long). The procedure counts as a combat action and requires a passed [Accurate←Cunning] test. An individual with the ability Trapper can roll a [Cunning←Cunning] test to disarm a trap, and does not require an instrument with the quality Long to do so.

Getting Free from a Trap
Traps often deal damage, specified in the description of the trap or, in the case of improvised traps, in the description of the ability Trapper. Furthermore, if the trap has such qualities it may hold the victim in place. If so, this is mentioned in the description, combined with information on what it takes to get free.

## Mechanical
[[Volatile]] (Novice [[Trapper]] or \[19\])
Mechanical traps come in many designs, but the basic version consists of two jagged semi-circles that slam shut when triggered. A passed [Strong←Cunning] test is required to get free, the latter being the trap-makers attribute value (the average trap-maker can be assumed to have Cunning 13 (–3)). Each attempt to break free counts as a combat action. Weak: The trap deals 1d8 damage. Moderate: The trap deals 1d10 damage. Strong: The trap deals 1d12 damage.
## Alchemical
[[Volatile]] (Adept [[Trapper]] and [[Pyrotechnics]] or Adept [[Trapper]] and \[19\]) & [[Volatile]] of used Alchemical Elixir
To scrape it off requires a primary action and a passed [Quick←Cunning] test, the latter being the mine-maker’s attribute value (the average alchemist can be assumed to have Cunning 13 (–3)). Allies trying to help the burning target may make separate tests in order to scrape off the substances.
