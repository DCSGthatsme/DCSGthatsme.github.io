## Ability
The character has realized that the creatures of the wild are best combated after having been caught and fettered.

Trained trappers can deploy and disarm both mechanical traps and alchemical mines. Furthermore, when the need arises, the character can quickly manufacture improvised traps from materials at hand.

Novice<br>Active. The character can effectively handle [[Mechanical Trap|Mechanical Traps]]. The character can also build an improvised trap, but this requires a whole turn to complete. An improvised trap functions as a Mechanical Trap, but it cannot be relocated and deals 1D6 damage. A Novice Trapper may also disarm traps with a successful \[[[Wit]]‚ÜêWit] test.

Adept<br>Active. The character can effectively handle [[Alchemical Trap|Alchemical Traps]]. An improvised trap made by the character now deals 1D8 damage.

Master<br>Active. The character is a renowned trapper who knows how to utilize any kind of trap. Traps are counted as one tier higher: Weak becomes Moderate, Moderate becomes Strong, and Strong traps allow the Trapper a second chance on success tests. The enemies' attempts to discover, disarm, or get free become more difficult; the damage dice are rolled twice and the higher outcome stands. For Alchemical Traps, the damage reroll only pertains to the initial reaction, not any ongoing effects. Improvised traps now deal 1D10 damage.
