# Ability
Whatever the material armors the character, the Man-at-arms ability gives them increased protection against hostile strikes and blows.

Novice<br>Passive. The character knows how to use their armor for maximum effect, which increases the armor's [[Toughness]] bonus by one die tier.

Adept<br>Passive. The character is used to wearing armor and can adapt their actions to its limitations. The armor's [[Impeding]] no longer has a negative effect on [[Agility]] or abilities based on Agility (including [[Defense]]).

Master<br>Reaction. The character may roll against Agility to counteract effects from Abilities or equipment that make enemy attacks ignore or reduce their Toughness value; if the test is successful the Toughness works as usual. [[Mystical Powers]] that ignore Toughness may not be blocked this way; they are not affected by the Man-at-arms ability.
