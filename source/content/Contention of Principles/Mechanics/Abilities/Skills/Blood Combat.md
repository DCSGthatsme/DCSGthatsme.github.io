# Ability
Only available if [[Agility]] + [[Might]] > 22

The character understands the power of the blood better than others. These insights allow them to use the power of spilled blood to their own advantage in combat â€“ whether the blood is theirs or the enemy's.

Novice<br>Reaction. The character draws strength from the blood they spill. When their [[Toughness]] has been halved, the character gains a second chance to succeed with all attack tests in melee go-time.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character's hits grow more powerful the more damaged they are; when their Toughness has been more than halved, all attacks they make in melee go-time deal an additional +1D8 damage.

Master<br>Reaction. The warrior draws vigor from the blood their enemies spill; half of the damage that the character deals during melee go-time (rounded down) is added to their Toughness.
