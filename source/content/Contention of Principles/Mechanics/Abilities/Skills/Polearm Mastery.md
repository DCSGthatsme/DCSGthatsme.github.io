The character is talented in the precepts of longshafted weapons. The spear is a simple weapon and anyone can quickly learn how to make good use of its length. The character's advanced skill with long weapons shows that a simple shaft of hardened wood can be a fearsome weapon in the hands of a trained warrior.

Novice<br>Passive. The damage dealt by [[Long]] weapons is increased one die tier.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character has truly mastered the long thrust. The Free Attacks gained with the Long [[Qualities|Quality]] via melee engagement are no longer subject to the "once per round" limitation for Free Attacks.

Master<br>Reaction. As a Master of long weapons, the character has the skill to keep their enemies at bay. The character can use the Free Attack with a polearm to keep an enemy from coming close enough to attack. For as long as the character succeeds in hitting the enemy, the enemy remains unable to attack the character with melee weapons â€“ whether or not the damage penetrates the enemy's [[Toughness]].
