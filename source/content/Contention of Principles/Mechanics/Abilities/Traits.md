Traits are [[abilities]] that are only gained or improved during character creation, as dictated by race.
## Long-lived
Once adulthood is reached, the aging process of the character slows down. The character can live up to two or even three centuries if their life is not shortened by violence, poison or disease. The creature's long lifespan makes it prone to do things at a slow pace, but this is compensated by the attitude that what is worth doing is worth doing well, which over time results in a considerable degree of expertise. Long-lived has no effect besides what it implies in terms of playing the role.

## Robust
The character belongs to a race of creatures that are naturally tall and often continue to grow their entire lives. But there are variations: some grow quickly, others more slowly while some hardly seems to grow at all.

Novice<br>Special. The character is close to seven feet tall and very strong. Such a towering body is easier to hit in combat, which is balanced by a greater natural toughness. The character's Defense is based on \[Agility –2\] and it can only use light armor, which must be custom-made and therefore costs twice the normal price. In return, the character naturally ignores 1D4 damage from each hit taken, in addition to any armor it wears. Furthermore, it can deal 1D4 extra damage with one melee attack each turn.

Adept<br>Special. The character is over eight feet tall, weighs about 500 pounds and has skin as though as bark. A creature like this packs quite the punch but is also easy to hit. The character's Defense is based on \[Agility –3\] and it can only use light armor, which must be custom-made and costs three times the normal price. In return, the character naturally ignores 1D6 damage from each hit taken, in addition to any armor it wears. Furthermore, it can deal 1D6 extra damage with one melee attack each turn.

Master<br>Special. The character is close to ten feet tall, weighs about half a ton and crushes lesser creatures while enemy weapons have a hard time penetrating their stone-like skin. It is very easy to hit a creature of this size, but equally hard to wound it seriously. The character's Defense is based on \[Agility –4\] and it can only use light armor (custom-made, costing four times the normal price). In return, the character ignores 1D8 damage from each hit taken, in addition to any armor it wears. Finally, it can deal 1D8 extra damage with one melee attack each turn.

## Short-lived
The character's life is short, even under favorable living conditions. All members of their race tend to reach adulthood in a handful of years, after which they start to lose their youthful vigor so that only a few ever live to see the age of forty. On the other hand, they are quick to learn and adapt to new surroundings, and they are often ready to face the world at the age of five. Short-lived has no effect besides what it implies in terms of playing the role.

## Survival Instinct
The character belongs to a race with a powerful life-force and an equally powerful will to survive. For some individuals this energy shows itself in clamorous hollering and an acute restlessness; for others it manifests itself in a more useful survival instinct.

Novice<br>Free. Thanks to their explosive survival instinct, the character may perform one extra Movement Action once per scene.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character trusts their instincts and has learned that rolling with the punches often saves your life. The character's finely honed survival instinct provides it with a permanent +1D4 to Armor.

Master<br>Free. There resides a powerful fighting spirit within each member of the character's race, and that spirit can show itself when the character is backed into a corner. The character has nurtured this hot-tempered aggression and may sacrifice a Movement Action once per scene to perform an extra Combat Action.
## Wisdom of the Ages
`APG`
The character is one of those who may use the know-how of previous generations to solve problems at hand. It is not without risks; the process incurs temporary corruption as if it was a mystical power.

Novice
Full turn. The character gets lost in a short trance. With a passed Resolute test, it gains access to the novice level of an optional ability, Mystical Traditions, Ritualist and Mystical Power excluded. The ability can be used for the rest of the scene, before fading from memory.

Adept
Active. The character’s closer connection to the collective memory makes the trance even shorter; other than that it works like the novice level.

Master
Active. The character can dig deeper into the collective memory. With a passed Resolute test, it gains access to the adept level of an optional ability, Mystical Traditions, Ritualist and Mystical Power excluded. The ability can be used for the rest of the scene, before fading from memory.

## Shapeshifter
The character has the capability to borrow the appearance of others for a period of time. For young changelings this ability comes naturally, and it can be hard for them not to adopt the appearance and mannerisms of people around them. Mature changelings usually develop greater control over the trait.

Novice<br>Free. With a successful die roll against Resolve, the character may adopt a false shape; the form, appearance, voice and clothes of another creature, but not that of a specific individual. The changeling can keep up the appearance for the duration of a scene, but then the illusion fades away. Everyone that the character interacts with will see through the illusion, unless the character succeeds with a \[Subtlety←Vigilance\] test.

Adept<br>Free. The character may, for a short period of time and with a successful Resolve test, adopt the form of specific individuals that the character has met, and can include clothes and attributes in the image. In combat against multiple opponents, the similarity is good enough to make it hard for enemies to hit their mark – there is a 50% chance that enemies attempting to hit the character hit their depicted companion instead. It takes concentration to maintain the illusory form, which means that the character must make a Resolve test each turn as well as a successful \[Resolve –Damage\] test each time the changeling suffers damage.

Master<br>Free. With a successful Resolve test the character may adopt the form of a specific individual and maintain it for the duration of a scene. Anyone who speaks with the character will be able to see through the illusion unless the character succeeds with a \[Subtlety←Vigilance\]. For a character to be able to fool people familiar with the depicted person, they must succeed with two tests, first at a distance and then another one if they start a conversation.

## Privileged
The character belongs to a race of high social standing within their society, and is therefore given advantages that others simply cannot have or must pay for, in either silver or hard work, to obtain. The character gets a second chance to succeed when taking on social challenges within their own society, and does not have to roll the dice unless it strives to accomplish something which is questionable or that may be next to impossible to achieve. Additionally, the character starts with 50 thaler in their purse.

## Earth Bound
`APG`
The creature is bound to the world in an intimate way, as if originating from the bones of the world and still being part of its foundation. It has no soul and suffers damage instead of corruption; temporary corruption causes bleeding wounds on its body. Permanent corruption instead causes a per- manent reduction to the basis for calculating the creatures Pain Threshold. In practice, this means that the Pain Threshold is reduced by 1 for every other point the creature suffers in permanent corruption. Its Toughness is not affected. If the Pain Threshold is reduced to zero, the creature dies of internal bleeding and failing organs. Once dead, the creature cannot become undead and it cannot be contacted with the ritual Necromancy. The corpse decays and reunites with the slop and dust of creation, without leaving any kind of spiritual trace behind.
