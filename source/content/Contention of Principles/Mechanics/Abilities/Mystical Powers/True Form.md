The mystic has spent many long nights closely studying lies and false guises, and is capable of making the surrounding world reveal its true nature.

Novice<br>Reaction. With a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test, the mystic's clarity allows them to see through every illusion, transformation or any other effect within sight that hides the true form of things. Revealed illusions disappear, while transformations remain intact, although the mystic can see what is behind them.

Adept<br>Active. With a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test, the mystic can make a Chain of creatures return to their true form. If the first attempt succeeds the mystic can make another attempt for the next creature, and so on until a test is failed. Nothing stops the creatures from transforming again, though.

Master<br>Active. As adept, but the mystic can make transformed creatures reveal their true form and then force them to maintain their original form. A Resolve test is required to make a target maintain their original form. The test is made on the targets' Initiative when/if they try to transform again.
