Bond: Fear, Appreciation

Adept<br>Active. The larval growth inside the body deals 1D6 damage each turn, ignoring Armor. The effect continues until the mystic fails a \[Resolve←Might\] test.

Master<br>Active. The larvae swarm inside the target's body and deal 1D8 damage each turn, ignoring Armor. The effect continues until the mystic fails a \[Resolve←Might\] test.
