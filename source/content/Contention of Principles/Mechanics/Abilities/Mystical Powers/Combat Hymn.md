title: "Mystical Power: Combat Hymn"

## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]<br>Material: None, but the mystic must sing out loud

There is a raw and untamed power in singing, and some mystics learn to sing while fighting to gain considerable extra strength when battling the enemy. The character is one of those who have learned to sing combat hymns to increase their chances in combat. The song is interrupted if the mystic uses another mystical power or if concentration is lost due to taking damage \[[[Resolve]] â€“Damage\].
