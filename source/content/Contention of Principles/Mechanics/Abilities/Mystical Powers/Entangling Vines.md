## Ability
Material: A handful of seeds or a tangle of roots<br>Crux: [[Appreciation]]

The earth is bound by roots, while objects above ground are often covered by vines. All that the mystic does is uses its will to stimulate the already ongoing processes of nature.

![[Mystical Power]]

Novice<br>Active. By rolling a successful [[Resolve]] test, the mystic calls forth entangling vines or roots from out of the earth and can ensnare an enemy. The ensnared creature cannot move but can use ranged weapons and powers. The creature is ensnared until the mystic fails a \[Resolve←[[Might]]\] test, starting the following round.

Adept<br>Active. The mystic can ensnare a Chain of creatures. If the mystic manages to ensnare a target with a successful Resolve test, then they can attempt to snare another one, and so on until an attempt fails. Starting the following round, a \[Resolve←Might\] test is made for each target to determine how many of them remain ensnared.

Master<br>Active. The mystic creates an entangling Chain of thorns. Those ensnared with a \[Resolve←Might\] test also suffers 1D6 damage per round from their thorny prison. The sharp thorns find gaps in the target's armor, so [[Toughness]] is ignored.
