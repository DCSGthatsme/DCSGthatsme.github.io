![[Sophistry#Mystical Powers]]
## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]<br>Material: Glass beads

By way of the shadows surrounding creatures, the world’s deeper conflicts are apparent to a character with Sublime Sight. Opening up one's mind in order to examine the world of shadows can provide invaluable insights, but it also entails great risk.

Novice<br>Active. The character can make a roll against \[[[Vigilance]]←[[Subtlety]]\] in an attempt to see insights into the target's [[Corruption]]: if they have ever encountered it, if they have any now, and if they are suffering from a stigma.

Adept<br>Free. As Novice, except a Free Action and the character also knows exactly how much Corruption the target has now and the nature of every stigma from which they are suffering.

Master<br>Free. As Adept, except no roll is required.

Active. The character can roll against \[[[Resolve]]←Subtlety\] to make the target's Corruption apparent to other observers for a day. It is as though characters nearby the target involuntarily get Sublime Sight at the Novice level with respect to the target.
## Notes
