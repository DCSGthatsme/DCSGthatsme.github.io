title: "Mystical Power: Enervating Throes"
---
## Ability
Only available if [[Charisma]] + [[Subtlety]] > 22<br>Crux: [[Fear]]<br>Material: Quills

The enemy is beset with a harrowing miasma which tears at their clothes, equipment, and flesh. At best, the target cannot act. At worst, they are driven mad or die.

![[Mystical Power]]

Novice<br>Active. The mystic calls forth transparent needles to attack an enemy. The target automatically fails all tests for concentration while using mystical powers; all other tests have a second chance to fail. The mystic must pass a Resolve test each turn in order for the spirits to continue their attacks.

Adept<br>Active. The mystic attacks ferociously and deals damage to [[Resolve]], adding to the effect described at the novice level. The damage dealt is 1D4 per turn, ignoring [[Toughness]]. If Resolve is reduced to zero, the target dies, presuming they are not allowed to roll death tests (like characters). The latter instead becomes temporarily insane – catatonic, crying or otherwise, unable to act – while rolling their death tests. The Resolve damage heals like other damages. The mystic must pass a Resolve test each turn in order for the spirits to continue their attack. Also, if the mystic takes damage, concentration will be broken if failing a \[Resolve –Damage\] test.

Master<br>Active. Like adept, but the attacks deal 1D6 damage to Resolve.
