## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]<br>Material: None, but the mystic must sing out loud

There is power in the heroic hymns of old. The mystic can sing while fighting, thereby filling their allies with courage and vigor. The song is interrupted if the mystic uses another mystical power or if concentration is lost by taking damage \[[[Resolve]] â€“Damage\].

Novice<br>Free. The character gives himself and all allies a +1 bonus to either [[Charisma]], Resolve, or [[Wit]] (each ally chooses what attribute will be affected) for as long as the singing continues.

Adept<br>Free. The character gives himself and all allies a +1 bonus to Charisma, Resolve, and Wit for as long as the singing continues.

Master<br>Free. The character and all allies gain a +1 bonus to Charisma, Resolve, and Wit for as long as the singing continues. Also, the temporary corruption of the character and all allies is reduced by 1D4 when the song begins; this corruption reducing effect may only be used once per scene.
