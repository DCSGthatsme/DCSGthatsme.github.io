# Ability
Material: A pupa or an egg.
Bond: Appreciation

The mystic has grasped that physical appearance is a dynamic concept, and knows how to use that insight to transform their enemies into weaker forms.

Novice<br>Active. With a successful roll against Resolve the mystic can turn a target into a harmless beast (mammal or reptile, the mystic decides which). The target stays in that form until the mystic breaks concentration or fails a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test. This test is made each turn on the mystic's Initiative. The harmless animal keeps the target's original Attributes but none of their abilities or powers and can neither attack nor use items.

Adept<br>Active. The mystic no longer has to concentrate to keep the Maltransformation active; it is ongoing until the mystic fails a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test.

Master<br>Active. The mystic can trigger a Chain of Maltransformations. If the mystic succeeds in transforming one target, they may attempt to transform another one, and so on until a transformation attempt fails. The Maltransformation is ongoing until the mystic fails a Resolve test, made each turn for each target.
