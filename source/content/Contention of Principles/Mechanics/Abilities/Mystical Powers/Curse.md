## Ability
Material: None, a dark glare is enough<br>Crux: [[Appreciation]], [[Fear]]

The mystic masters a stare which can curse enemies on the battlefield.

Novice<br>Free. Once per turn, the mystic's dark glare automatically gives an enemy a second chance to fail all success tests meant to affect the mystic (roll twice, the action fails if one of the tests is a failure). This effect is ongoing until the mystic fails a [[Resolve]] test.

![[Mystical Power]]

Adept<br>Free. Like novice, but the enemy has a second chance to fail all their success tests regardless of target. The effect is ongoing until the mystic fails a Resolve test.

Master<br>Active. The mystic puts a curse of death upon an enemy. The enemy suffers 1D6 damage, ignoring [[Toughness]], for all actions it tries to perform. The target suffers no damage if it remains still and passive. This effect is active until the mystic fails a Resolve test.
