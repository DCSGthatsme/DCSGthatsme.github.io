## Ability
Only available if [[Resolve]] + [[Subtlety]] > 22<br>Crux: [[Fear]]<br>Material: A sharp weapon to cut the world's fabric

A fearful mystic's lack of respect for the laws of nature lends them the astounding ability to tear at and bend apparent constants like time and space. One way to make use of this is to temporarily banish creatures from the world of the living. This poses a danger since every failed attempt to use the power risks summoning a violent [[Phantasms|phantasm]]. If this happens, the phantasm attacks a random victim, though not someone who is protected by an Unholy Aura or whose soul is already thoroughly corrupt. The kind of phantasm that comes is determined by the Game Master based upon the target's characteristics.

![[Mystical Power]]

Novice<br>Active. The character sends an enemy beyond existence. The enemy returns one turn later with the mystic's acting precedence, in the same location, and having suffered 1D4 Damage (ignoring Armor) and 1D4 temporary corruption. If the mystic fails a \[[[Resolve]]←Resolve\] test, a phantasm is automatically summoned the enemy's place.

Adept<br>Active. The enemy must struggle to return to reality; each turn the enemy may roll a Resolve test, a success brings it back. Every turn spent beyond reality deals 1D4 damage (ignoring Armor) and 1D4 temporary corruption. If the target dies or becomes blight-born, the enemy is gone for good. Every turn after the first, the mystic must pass a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test to stop a phantasm from appearing in the enemy's place. If the initial test for using the power fails, the mystic must immediately succeed a Resolve test to stop a raging phantasm from ejecting from the enemy. The mystic may choose to not try to stop the phantasm's creation, no matter if it comes as an effect of a failed attempt to use the power or as a consequence of a successful long-lasting rift.

Master<br>Reaction. Once per turn, one enemy that attacks the mystic in melee is at risk of being expelled beyond reality, \[Resolve←Resolve\]. If expelled, they suffer the same effect as at the novice level. A failed test has no effect; there is no risk that a phantasm enters into the world.
