Material: A few drops of wine<br>Crux: [[Captivation]]

The mystic's understanding of the labyrinth of the senses can cause an enemy to lose themself inside their own mind. Confused enemies become paralyzed or lose their ability to separate friend from foe.

Novice<br>Active. The mystic can confuse an enemy with a successful \[[[Resolve]]←Resolve\] test, making the enemy unaware of their actions. Roll 1D6 each turn until the mystic breaks concentration or fails a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test: 1–2, the target stands still, blinking stupidly; 3–4, the target attacks whichever of their allies is closest; 5–6, the target attacks whichever of their enemies is closest. If there is any uncertainty regarding who is closest to the target, roll a die to decide.

Adept<br>Active. The mystic can confuse an enemy without having to concentrate. The Confusion is ongoing until the mystic fails a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test. A new test must be made each turn.

Master<br>Active. The mystic creates a Chain of Confusion. If the mystic manages to confuse a target with a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test, then it may continue with another target and so on, until the mystic fails a test. Resolve is then tested each turn for each target to decide which of them remain confused.
