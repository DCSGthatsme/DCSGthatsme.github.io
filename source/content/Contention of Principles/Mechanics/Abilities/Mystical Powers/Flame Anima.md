title: "Mystical Power: Flame Anima"
---
## Ability
Only available if [[Resolve]] + [[Might]] > 22<br>Crux: [[Exaltation]]<br>Material: None, but those with Flame Anima often display physical signs of their attraction to fire; a burning gaze, red hair or heat that radiates from the body

Pyromancers have found that those who dedicate their lives to the study of fire in time learn to instinctively use it as a shield and a weapon. It is even said that the most devoted learn to manipulate the force of hostile fires and paradoxically enough use these burning powers to heal themselves when wounded.

![[Mystical Power]]

Novice<br>Reaction. When the mystic is hit in melee combat, flames strike out at the attacker, dealing 1D6 damage. Also, the mystic suffers less damage from fire, meaning that they have +1D6 [[Toughness]] against damage from that element.

Adept<br>Reaction. Like the novice level, except the protection from fire and the damage dealt against those attacking the mystic in melee combat are rolled with 1D10 instead of 1D6.

Master<br>Reaction. The master's power is so great that they do not take damage but is instead healed by fire. The mystic recovers half of any damage that would have been dealt by fire (if the mystic should have suffered 4 damage, they instead heal 2 [[Health]]). This also pertains to fire created by the mystic when using other powers besides Flame Anima. In addition, the flames that lash out from the mystic when they are attacked now also retaliate at range. Powers that affect the mind will not trigger such a retaliation, but powers which potentially deal damage do. The striking flames deal 1D10 damage and Toughness works as usual.
