## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]<br>Material: A flask, water, and an appropriate herb

Alchemy is a field of [[Imbuement]] specialized to alter and enhance the existing properties of things. Alchemy requires a scientific knowledge and rigor that other "artifice" imbuement does not.

The character is knowledgeable in the mysteries of alchemy. With the right ingredients, the character can prepare various [[Alchemical Substances]].

Novice<br>Special. With a successful roll against [[Wit]] the character can gather herbs and minerals to create one dose of a Novice Alchemical Substance. Additionally, the Alchemist gets a +2 bonus on rolls to handle [[Volatile]] Alchemical Substances.

> Alchemists are used to working with explosive and volatile substances, and are therefore able to handle alchemical grenades correctly and efficiently. Hence, alchemists – starting at the novice level – do not risk failing catastrophically with alchemical grenades

Adept<br>Special. As an acknowledged alchemist the character can roll against Wit to gather herbs and minerals to create one dose of an Adept Alchemical Substance or 1D4 doses of a Novice Alchemical Substance.

Master<br>Special. The character can, as a widely renowned alchemist, roll against Wit to gather herbs and minerals to create one dose of a Master Alchemical Substance, 1D4 doses of an Adept Alchemical Substance, or 1D8 doses of a Novice Alchemical Substance.
