![[Sophistry#Mystical Powers]]
## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]<br>Material: A flask, water, and an appropriate herb

Alchemy is a field of [[Imbuement]] specialized to alter and enhance the existing properties of things. Alchemy requires a scientific knowledge and rigor that other "artifice" imbuement does not.

The character is knowledgeable in the mysteries of alchemy. With the right ingredients, the character can prepare various [[Alchemical Elixirs]].

The character may attempt to prepare an elixir once per adventure. This attempt can be performed before the start of an adventure or at any appropriate moment during the adventure – for example when traveling through a forest or when passing through a cave where potent ingredients may be found.

Novice<br>Special. With a successful roll against [[Wit]] the character can gather herbs and minerals to create one dose of a novice elixir.

> Alchemists are used to working with explosive and volatile substances, and are therefore able to handle alchemical grenades correctly and efficiently. Hence, alchemists – starting at the novice level – do not risk failing catastrophically with alchemical grenades

Adept<br>Special. As an acknowledged alchemist the character can roll against Wit to gather herbs and minerals to create one dose of an adept elixir or 1D4 doses of a novice elixir.

Master<br>Special. The character can, as a widely renowned alchemist, roll against Wit to gather herbs and minerals to create one dose of a master elixir, 1D4 doses of an adept elixir or 1D8 doses of a novice elixir.
