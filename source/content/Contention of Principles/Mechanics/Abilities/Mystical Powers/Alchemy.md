Alchemy is a field of Imbuement specialized to magically alter and enhance the existing properties of things. Where [[Artifice]], the other field of Imbuement, takes an imaginative, even artistic mind, Alchemy requires a scientific, rigorous mind.

Adept<br>Special. As an acknowledged alchemist the character can roll against Wit to gather herbs and minerals to create one dose of a Moderate Alchemical Substance or 1D4 doses of a Weak Alchemical Substance.

Master<br>Special. The character can, as a widely renowned alchemist, roll against Wit to gather herbs and minerals to create one dose of a Strong Alchemical Substance, 1D4 doses of an Moderate Alchemical Substance, or 1D8 doses of a Weak Alchemical Substance.
