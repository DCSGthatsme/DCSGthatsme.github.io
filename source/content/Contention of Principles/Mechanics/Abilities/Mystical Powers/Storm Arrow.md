# Ability
Material: Arrows or crossbow bolts<br>Crux: [[Appreciation]]

The mystic can ask the wind to lift and carry arrows towards their enemies.

Novice<br>Active. The mystic enchants a handful of arrows (up to five) with a successful Resolve test. The arrows then float next to the mystic for the rest of the scene and can be fired, once per turn, as a Free Action (one arrow can be fired the same turn that the power is activated). The arrows hit their target automatically. Any quality or special ability that the arrow might have is added to the effect. The arrow normally deals 1D6 damage.

Adept<br>Active. The arrows are enchanted as above, but in the hands of the adept mystic they now deal 1D8 damage. As a Combat Action, the mystic can send two arrows against either the same target or two different targets. If the mystic performs this Action, then they cannot fire another arrow as a Free Action.

Master<br>Active. The mystic can use a Combat Action to fire three arrows against one or separate targets. If the mystic performs this Action, then they cannot fire another arrow as a Free Action.
