## Ability
Crux: [[Exaltation]]<br>Material: A shard of glass

The mystic raises an ethereal shield against the weapons of their enemies. The shield is invisible until attacked, at which time it glitters as if struck by sunlight.

Novice<br>Active. With a successful roll against [[Resolve]] the mystic surrounds themself with a warm glow. This glow provides +1D4 [[Toughness]]. Also, any creatures with Corruption who attack the mystic with a melee attack suffer 1D4 damage from the glow, ignoring Toughness. The ethereal shield lasts until the end of the scene.

Adept<br>Active. As at the novice level, but the Toughness and the damage dealt are 1D6. Also, an ally within sight can be included in the effect of the ethereal shield.

Master<br>Active. As at the novice level, but the Toughness and the damage dealt are 1D8. Two of the mystic's allies can be included in the effect of the ethereal shield.
