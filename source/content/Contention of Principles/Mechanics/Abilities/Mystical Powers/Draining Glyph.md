## Ability
Crux: [[Fear]]<br>Material: A carefully crafted glyph

The mystic creates a glyph that upon activation becomes a whirling vortex, sucking the life-force from the enemy. The glyph affects all enemies who can see the symbol and are in front of it.

![[Mystical Power]]

Novice<br>Active. With a \[[[Resolve]]←[[Might]]\] test the mystic can damage every enemy in the vicinity (one test per target). The damage is 1D4, ignoring Armor. The effect lasts until the mystic fails a Resolve test or loses concentration \[Resolve –Damage\].

Adept<br>Active. Same as the novice level, but the effect lasts until the mystic fails a Resolve test.

Master<br>Active. The master can direct part of the drained energy into himself or his allies; the stolen life-force heals the mystic or one of their allies, returning 1D4 points of Toughness per turn for as long as effect is active.
