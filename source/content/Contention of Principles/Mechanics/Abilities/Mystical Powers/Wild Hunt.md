## Ability
Only available if [[Agility]] + [[Charisma]] > 22<br>Crux: [[Appreciation]]<br>Material: The fur of a beast dead from natural causes

Nature may seem dark and full of conflicts, trapped in an eternal cycle of birth, strife and death. But to mystics who have the capability to see the deeper truth, there is a perfect imbalance to this cycle; a higher form of harmony. This insight can be used by the mystic to acquire the help of seemingly hostile beasts. The summoned beasts may not be of the same type as the enemies; otherwise the type is decided by which types occur naturally in the environment. The mystic dictates how the beasts act during the scene, after which they turn and leave the area.

Novice<br>Active. The mystic can summon one weak beast to aid them in combat.

Adept<br>Active. The mystic calls one ordinary beast or 1D4 weak beasts to aid them in combat.

Master<br>Active. The mystic calls one challenging beast, 1D4 ordinary beasts or 1D6 weak beasts to them in combat.
