Material: A fistful of pure brimstone<br>Crux: [[Captivation]]

The mystic can unleash the rampaging spirit of fire and burn their enemies to cinders, or at least scorch them severely.

Novice<br>Active. The mystic lashes out with fire and brimstone against a target. If the mystic succeeds with a \[[[Resolve]]←[[Agility]]\] test, the cascade deals 1D12 points of damage. If the mystic fails the test the cascade deals only 1D6 damage.

Adept<br>Active. The mystic unleashes a Chain of burning energy. If the mystic succeeds with a \[Resolve←Agility\] test, the cascade deals 1D12 points of damage. If the mystic fails the test the cascade deals only 1D6 damage. If the target suffers the full 1D12 damage, the mystic may try to steer the flaming energy towards an additional target, and so on until the mystic fails a \[Resolve←Agility\] test.

Master<br>Active. The mystic unleashes a veritable storm of flaming and smoking energies. If the mystic passes a \[Resolve←Agility\] test, the cascade deals 1D12 points of damage. If the mystic fail the test the cascade only deals 1D6 damage. Even if the mystic should fail a test the Chain does not stop; it continues to strike new oppenents until a second test is failed.
