Crux: [[Captivation]]<br>Material: A glass pearl

The mystic can use their mind to move and throw loose objects, or even enemies.

Novice<br>Active/Reaction. The mystic can actively hurl objects in the surrounding area as weapons or use them reactively, to block incoming attacks. The mystic will have to make a \[[[Resolve]]←[[Agility]]\] test to attack this way and deals 1D8 damage if successful. If an object is used as a temporary shield, make a \[Resolve←[[Exactitude]]\] test to block incoming physical attacks or a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test for magic projectiles. The object is destroyed after one hit, either dealt or blocked.

Adept<br>Active. The mystic is capable of using the power of their mind \[Resolve←[[Might]]\] to lift, and throw, an enemy. A thrown enemy lands a Movement Action away and suffers 1D8 damage. The enemy lands on their back, unless it makes a successful Agility test.

Master<br>Active. The mystic can throw a Chain of enemies if succeeding with a \[Resolve←Might\] test. The mystic starts with the first target and keeps making tests until one fails. The thrown enemies land a Movement Action away and suffer 1D8 damage. The enemies land on their back, unless they make a successful test against Agility.
