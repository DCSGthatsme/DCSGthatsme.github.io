![[Mystical Power]]

Novice<br>Active. With a successful [[Resolve]] test the mystic envelops themself in an aura of energies that is harmful to abominations and undead. The target suffers 1D6 points of damage, ignoring Armor.

The mystic can exclude allied abominations or undead from the effect of the Lustrous Aura.

Adept<br>Active. The aura now deals 1D8 damage to abominations and undead, while living creatures heal 1D4 points of [[Toughness]] each turn.

Master<br>Active. Same effect as at adept level, but the effect against abominations and undead is increased to 1D10. Living allies now heal 1D6 points of Toughness each turn.
