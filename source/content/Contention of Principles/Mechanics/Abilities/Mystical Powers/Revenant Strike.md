Material: A weapon tainted by a Desecrating Rite.
Bond: Fear

The mystic's weapon is touched by dark energies, which increases the damage dealt against living creatures. Worse, those slain will rise again, as walking corpses controlled by the sorcerer. Undead created by revenant strikes have the same statistics as the dragoul (see page 230). The undead returns to its state of true death at the end of the scene.

Novice<br>Active. The sorcerer ignites a malicious flame around their melee weapon, which then deals 1D4 additional damage till the scene ends.

Adept<br>Reaction. As novice, and creatures slain by the Revenant Strike rise again the following turn, loyal to the sorcerer.

Master<br>Free. As Adept, but the effect is activated as a free action and a hit deals +1D8 damage, instead of +1D4.
