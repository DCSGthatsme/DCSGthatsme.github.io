## Ability
Crux: [[Exaltation]]<br>Material: A prepared symbol

Intricate runes emit energies that can temporarily blind those who are bedazzled by the light. The effect of a Blinding Symbol is immediately suspended if the victim uses a dose of Eye Drops.

Novice<br>Active. The runes trigger a chain of blinding energies. The target closest to the symbol is blinded if the mystic passes a \[[[Resolve]]←Resolve\] test; if this succeeds, an attempt is made to blind the next enemy and so on, until a test fails. The victims are only blinded for one turn before automatically regaining their sight.

Adept<br>Active. Same effect as the novice level. However, the effect lasts until the mystic fails a Resolve test or loses concentration \[Resolve –Damage\].

Master<br>Active. Same effect as the novice level. However, the effect lasts until the afflicted regains Toughness from healing powers or elixirs.
