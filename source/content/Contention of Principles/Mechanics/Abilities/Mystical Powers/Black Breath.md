## Ability
Crux: [[Fear]]<br>Material: The mystic's own permanent corruption

A mystic with permanent corruption can spew out its inner darkness and infect others with corruption, or heal already tainted creatures.

![[Mystical Power]]

Novice<br>Active. One (1) creature is hit; roll 1D4 against its total corruption. If the roll is equal to or lower than the corruption value, the creature heals an amount equal to the outcome of the roll; if higher, the creature suffers the outcome in temporary corruption.

Adept<br>Active. Like Novice, but the roll is 1D6.

Master<br>Active. Same as Adept level, but the attack is made in a chain, where another target is hit if the previous one suffered corruption. As soon as someone is healed, the chain is broken.
