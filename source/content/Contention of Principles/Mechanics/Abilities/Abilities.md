## Mystical Power
The character has access to one or more mystical powers. These powers have either been obtained as a gift, a curse, through assiduous studies or as a consequence of a deep and dedicated faith. The character's power may have a crux of a [[Principle Bond]] (Appreciation, Captivation, Exaltation, Fear), which all have their benefits and disadvantages. The character may also be a Mystic without a bond, with a homebrewed theory as to where these powers come from and what they are meant for. For more information see Chapter 18: Mystical Traditions (page 126).

Each Mystical Power is its own ability and is purchased separately. For a more detailed description of the different mystical powers, see Chapter 19: Mystical Powers (page 130).

The character suffers one point (1) of permanent Corruption each time they learn a new mystical power. The Corruption can be reduced if the power is part of a mystical tradition that the character belongs to. The character also suffers 1D4 temporary Corruption each time this power is used. Again, the Corruption suffered can be reduced if the power is considered a part of a tradition that the character belongs to (see Shadow & Corruption, page 174).

Novice<br>Special. The character has mastered the power's novice level.

Adept<br>Special. The character has mastered the power's adept level.

Master<br>Special. The character has mastered the power's master level.

## Ritualist
The character has learned how mystical powers can be channeled through rituals â€“ powerful but time-consuming magical practices. This knowledge may come from studying under a teacher or from self-studies with a ritual codex.

The character suffers one (1) permanent Corruption from each ritual it learns, except if the ritual belongs to a mystical tradition practiced by the character. In the latter case the character is spared the blight of Corruption.

When it comes to performing rituals, the character suffers 1D4 temporary Corruption, unless under relevant [[Principle Bond]]. Performing rituals covered by the character's tradition only gives one (1) point of temporary Corruption.

The Ritualist ability makes it possible for the character to recognize what ritual has been performed by examining symbols and components remaining on the scene, and also to deduce the effects of the ritual, even if they have not mastered it.

Novice<br>Special. The character has learned to perform one (1) ritual. The ritual may belong to any mystical tradition, but the character must have access to the ritual in order to learn and memorize it. The knowledge may be gained from a tutor involved in the same organization as the character, from a codex found in the ruins of Symbaroum or from another ritualist who imparts the knowledge as a reward for services rendered.

Adept<br>Special. The character has learned to perform up to two additional rituals (three in total), again from any mystical tradition, but bound to the same conditions as those presented at the novice level.

Master<br>Special. The character has learned to perform up to three additional rituals (six rituals in total). Just as before, the

Master<br>Ritualist is not limited to the rituals of a single mystical tradition, but must have access to the ritual to be able to learn and memorize it.
