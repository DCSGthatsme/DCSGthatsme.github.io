* Active Action: The ability is an attack or similar Combat Action. Some of the active abilities generate extra Actions. These extra Actions may not be used to perform an additional active Action, but they benefit from any passive abilities that the character may have.
* Free Action: This Action may be used an unlimited number of times per turn in addition to a character's usual two Actions, for as long as it is allowed by any conditions specified in the description of the ability.
* Passive Action: The ability does not require a Combat Action to be activated; in other words, the ability is always active. If a character has two or more passive abilities, then they are all considered active at the same time.
* Reaction: The ability is a Reaction to some other Action and therefore doesn't count against the two Actions a character can perform each turn. Reactive Actions work outside the usual acting order, since a Reaction is performed as a consequence of a triggering Action, regardless of acting order. Reactions can always make use of passive abilities, but never active ones.
* Special Action: The ability works in a special way, detailed in its description.

> Some abilities can be used “once per adventure.” This can be handled in two ways, depending on what the gaming group prefers. If the characters also have active periods in-between adventures, where they engage in various activities (working, running a business or something like that), these abilities may be rolled during that time frame; some characters spend the down-time in their laboratory, their smithy and so on. If the group is totally committed to continuous adventuring it may be necessary to roll for these abilities at the start of each new adventure, or to find a practical situation during the adventure.
