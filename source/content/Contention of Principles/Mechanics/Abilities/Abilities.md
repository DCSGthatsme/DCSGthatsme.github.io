## Acrobatics
The character has learned the art of acrobatic maneuvering. The nimbleness of the acrobat provides an advantage when trying to withdraw from close combat or when quickly wanting to reach the center of an enemy formation.

Novice<br>Reaction. The character may roll against Agility to avoid Free Attacks from enemies in melee combat, either when trying to slip past an enemy or when attempting to withdraw from melee. Should the test fail, the player must choose for their character to either remain in their original place or to move anyway and suffer a Free Attack from the opponent.

Adept<br>Free. If the character is knocked down they may attempt to jump back up again as a Free Action by making a Agility test. If the test fails the character has to spend a Movement Action to get back on their feet, as usual.

Master<br>Reaction. The character can utilize their enemies as shields in battle. In combat with more than one opponent, the character may once per turn use an enemy as a shield and have that enemy suffer a successful hit instead of the character. That opponent cannot defend against the attack, but the master acrobat has to make a successful roll against Agility for the enemy to take the hit.

## Agile Combat
`APG`
Only available to Iron Sworn
During combat in wooded areas and hilly terrain the distance between opponents can shift quickly, from ranged to melee. The character has developed techniques for handling these rapid shifts between weapon types, and at their most skilled among can dance forth over the battlefield, seamlessly alternating between melee and ranged weapons and using every hostile attack for making counter-strikes.

Novice<br>Passive. The character can split their movement and perform one part of the movement action before the combat action, and the other part after. This is done in order to make maximum use of the terrain and cover. The character still suffers Free Attacks from enemies if the movement leads into or through melee combat distance.

Adept<br>Passive. As a part of their combat action, the character may freely switch between weapons. This only pertains to changing weapons; it does not provide an extra action to be used for anything else. For instance, the character may start holding two weapons, move a part of their movement range, and as a combat action switch to a bow, fire it, and then switch back to two weapons. Finally, the rest of the movement is made.

Master<br>Reaction. The character gains a second chance to pass all Defense tests against Free Attacks provoked by withdrawing from melee. In addition, every such Free Attack against the character lets the Iron Sworn make their own Free Attack against the enemy. The character may freely switch weapons for these counter-strikes and choose the tool that fits the situation best.).

## Armored Mystic
`APG`
Only available to Templars
The armored mystic has developed techniques for performing miracles while wearing full armor.

Novice<br>Passive. The character's mystical powers are not affected by wearing medium armor. The armor affects Defense as usual.

Adept<br>Passive. The character's mystical powers are not affected by wearing heavy armor. The armor affects Defense as usual.

Master<br>Passive. The armored mystic has transcended the limitations of the armor, and may instead benefit from it. A +1D4 bonus is added to the armor's protection value when the mystic wears it, since mystical energies flow through the steel.

## Arrow Jab
`APG`
In the chaos of the battlefield, archers sometimes find themselves dragged into the melee. To handle this, techniques on how to use ranged weapons at close range have been developed. This ability may be used with any kind of bow or crossbow.

Novice<br>Reaction. As a reaction to a melee attack against them, the character can draw an arrow and use it to stab an enemy. The character must succeed with a normal attack roll against the enemy; a successful hit deals 1D6 damage and the qualities of the projectile (if any) are counted.

Adept<br>Reaction. Like the novice level, but 1D8 damage.

Master<br>Reaction. Like the adept level, but the master also gains a Free Attack with the bow if the jab attack hits. The master stabs with the projectile, then (if successful) loads the bow to make a normal ranged attack at the target. If using a crossbow, this requires that it already be loaded and that the initial stab is made with another bolt, or that the character is in possession of a repeating crossbow.

## Artifact Crafting`?`
`APG`
Only available to Artifact Crafters
The glory days of artifact crafting seem to have passed and the powerful secrets of the old rune smiths are lost. However, even in the shadow of the growing corruption, the creative arts still linger on, if in a more modest way. The character is trained in the art of artifact crafting and can create artifacts of the lower order. Higher artifacts can nowadays only be found while excavating Symbaroum's ruins, but artifact crafters belong to a tradition that still holds its head high, in spite of shadows and darkness.

The character is also knowledgeable about legendary artifacts and can discern how artifacts work. Artifact Crafting corresponds to the ability Loremaster when analyzing artifacts, but it does not affect the use of them.

The artifacts are described in detail in the Equipment chapter, page 123-127APG.

Novice<br>Once per adventure. With a passed Wit test, the character can craft one novice level artifact.

Adept<br>Once per adventure. As an acknowledged artifact crafter, a passed Wit test lets the character craft one adept level artifact.

Master<br>Once per adventure. As a famous artifact crafter, a passed Wit test lets the character craft one master level artifact.

## Axe Artist
`APG`
By tradition, many warriors carry axes into battle, and among these fighters special techniques have been developed – techniques which make full use of the axe's potential. In the hands of the character, the axe is an effective tool of combat.

The weapon used must be an axe of either heavy or single-handed model

Novice<br>Active. The first thing an axe artist learns is to strike with the short-end of the axe in order to induce distracting pain before a mightier blow. The short-end thrust deals 1D6 damage and stuns the enemy if the character passes a \[Exactitude←Resolve\] test, meaning that the character gets to make an immediate Free Attack.

Adept<br>Active. Next up is learning the powerful double-strike: to strike with one side of the axe and then follow up by striking a blow with the other. The character makes two attacks in one combat action, both of them at one dice tier lower than normal (1D10=1D8).

Master<br>Passive. The axe master returns to the heart of axe fighting, the mighty blow. Every hit with the axe deals +1D4 damage, limited to one hit per combat action.

## Backstab
The character has learned how to exploit weaknesses in an enemy's defense, and will not let an opportunity go by without making a Backstab.

Novice<br>Reaction. One attack per turn made from Advantage deals +1D4 damage in addition to any damage already inflicted thanks to the Advantage. The character may use Subtlety instead of Exactitude when making attacks while at an Advantage. Backstab may only be performed once per turn, regardless of other circumstances.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character's Backstab deals extra damage (as above) and also causes a bleeding wound to the enemy. The attack opens a wound that bleeds heavily, inflicting 1D4 damage each turn following the attack. The enemy continues to bleed until healed by an herbal cure, the Medicus ability or in some other way.

Master<br>Reaction. The character's Backstab deals 1D8 extra damage and causes a bleeding wound to the enemy, just like at adept level. There are no longer any limits to how many backstabs a Master can perform each turn. All attacks are backstabs as long as the conditions for Advantage are met (see page 162).

## Berserker
Feared barbarian warriors have developed the practice of working themselves into a berserker frenzy before battle. By letting the repressed anger of the heart strengthen their limbs, the character can unleash a fuming rage that, if channeled correctly, might determine which side will emerge victorious from the battle.

Novice<br>Free. As a Free Action, the character may enter into a murderous frenzy to solely focus on hurting the enemy, dealing 1D6 extra damage when fighting in melee combat. The downside of this frenzy is that the character cannot defend themself properly. The attribute on which Defense is based, is considered to be 5 when calculating Defense.

Adept<br>Reaction. The rage is like armor to the character. They ignore 1D4 damage from each hit suffered while in a berserker rage.

Master<br>Free. The character has managed to harness their rage without losing any of their power. The character can utilize this capacity to both deal and ignore extra damage, while still being able to defend themself as normal.

## Blacksmith
`APG`
Most tribes have their blacksmiths, which says something about their importance.

The cost of crafting objects is half of the listed price and if the blacksmith later sells the item, they get the list price in payment. In other words, the profit made by the blacksmith is half the listed price.

This ability may be used once per adventure, preferably during a quiet interlude (or between adventures if that seems more reasonable). Should the item be of a consumable nature (like arrows or bolts), the blacksmith can forge 10 copies at a time.

Novice<br>Special. With a passed Wit test, the character can make a novice item. The character can also patch damaged armor or adapt armor to fit creatures of larger or smaller sizes. Novice items are all ordinary weapons and armor, including those with the qualities Short and Long. No other qualities can be crafted by the novice smith.

Adept<br>Special. With a passed Wit test, the character can make an adept item, featuring one quality besides Short or Long. All weapons and armor mentioned in the rules can be crafted by the adept, except items with mystical qualities and those that have more than one quality besides Short or Long. Note that the adept cannot remove negative qualities from items.

Master`?`
Special. With a passed Wit test, the character can make a master item. Master Blacksmiths have the capability to add several qualities to weapons and armor, and also to remove negative qualities. Adding to that, they may instill mystical qualities into all kinds of weapons and armor. For each added or removed quality, the list price of the item is cumulatively increased by ×5. Mystical qualities increase the value by ×10.

## Blood Combat
`APG`
Only available to `?`
The character understands the power of the blood better than others. These insights allow them to use the power of spilled blood to their own advantage in combat – whether the blood is theirs or the enemy's.

Novice<br>Reaction. The character draws strength from the blood it spills. When their Toughness has been halved, the character gains a second chance to succeed with all attack tests in melee combat.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character's hits grow more powerful the more damaged they are; when Toughness has been more than halved, all attacks made by the character in melee combat deal an additional +1D8 in damage.

Master<br>Reaction. The warrior is healed by the blood spilled by the enemy; half of the damage that the character deals in melee combat is added to their Toughness, rounded down.

## Bodyguard
The character is trained to place themself in the way of painful strikes and lethal blows aimed at a protected person.

Novice<br>Reaction. With a successful Resolve test, the character may take blows directed against an ally. They may not defend against attacks redirected upon themself; they hit automatically.

Adept<br>Reaction. As Novice, but the character's capacity as a guardian allows them to defend themself against all attacks aimed at the person they are protecting.

Master<br>Reaction. As Adept, but the character is a veritable patron. As a Reaction, the master Bodyguard also gets to make a Free Attack against anyone making a melee attack aimed at the person under their protection.

## Cheap Shot
`APG`
The character knows special self-defense techniques of a more "dirty" variety.

Novice<br>Active. Cheap Shots like a headbutt or nut shot come naturally to the character in stressful situations. Such an attack deals 1D6 damage, and if the opponent is damaged the character also gains a Free Attack against them.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character performs a normal melee attack and if it deals damage, they add a trip or a tackle. Such a maneuver knocks the opponent to the ground if the character succeeds with a \[Wit←Agility\] test.

Master<br>Reaction. Every enemy who engages the character in melee suffers a bloody riposte dealing 1D6 damage directly after their attack. The riposte always hits a weak spot and consequently ignores any armor.

## Dominate
With nothing but presence, gaze and voice, strong personalities can force weaker minds to bend in the midst of a raging battle. The character is trained in this art of subduing combat.

In social situations, this ability can also be used to scare someone into obedience and force secrets out of them.

Novice<br>Passive. The character can dominate and outmaneuver an enemy combatant by using their convincing personality. The character may use Charisma instead of Exactitude in melee combat.

Adept<br>Free. The character can, as a Free Action and with a successful \[Charisma←Resolve\] test, force an enemy to hesitate in melee combat. A hesitating enemy will not attack the character this turn. If possible, it attacks one of the character's allies instead.

Master<br>Active. The character can subdue an enemy with a passed \[Charisma←Resolve\] test. A subdued enemy can be forced to stand down and negotiate, to flee from an ongoing battle (if possible), or surrender if it is impossible to flee. When already in combat, the enemy must first be wounded by the character or by one of the character's allies before it can be subdued.

## Ensnare
`APG`
Using weapons like bolas, nets, or the long whip, many fighters and hunters of barbarian origin learn to limit the movement of enemies or prey. The character is trained in the ensnaring techniques used to gain Advantage in melee or to capture prey alive.

Novice<br>Active. The character gains a second chance to ensnare a target (requires a weapon with the quality Ensnaring, see page 118).

Adept<br>Active. In addition to the novice effect, the character gains a second chance to bring down an ensnared enemy (requires a weapon with the quality Ensnaring, see page 118).

Master<br>Reaction. The character's skill with ensnaring weapons is such that every ensnaring attack is assumed to hit the target's neck and have a strangling effect; besides the ensnaring effect and the chance to bring down the enemy, the target suffers 1D6 damage, ignoring armor. If the target reaches 0 Toughness, the character can choose to make it unconscious instead of dying.

## Exceptional Attribute
All the character's senses, as well as their physical and mental capacity, can be improved. By practicing a little bit each day, the muscles can grow stronger, the eyes sharper and intellect vaster. This ability enhances the character's basic survival capability.

A version of this Ability may be chosen for each primary Attribute. (ie Exceptional Resolve, Exceptional Wit)

Novice<br>Special. The character has cultured one of their Attributes through hard work, which increases the Attribute value by +1.

Adept<br>Special. As novice, but the ability increases the Attribute value by +2 in total.

Master<br>Special. As novice, but the ability increases the Attribute value by +3 in total.

## Feat of Strength
`APG`
Only available to Warriors
The warrior's spirit is strengthened in combat, giving them miraculous power when needed. The character is one of those who have found this source of aggression within, and know how to make use of it.

Novice<br>Passive. The character can handle taking a beating and counts Toughness as \[Might +5\]. This does not affect the Pain Threshold, which is based on Might/2 as usual.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character grows stronger by suffering damage. When the character's Toughness is halved, they have a second chance to pass all tests against Might, including attacks rolled against Might.

Master<br>Reaction. The character grows even stronger when severely damaged. When the character's Toughness is halved, they deal +1D4 melee damage, in addition to the effect mentioned at the adept level.

## Feint
Persons and creatures that lack the will or strength to wield heavy melee weapons have instead developed techniques for feinting. This ability demands a weapon with either the Short or the Precise quality. Thanks to the skill of the character, these weapons can be handled in a both discreet and confusing manner.

Novice<br>Passive. The character can choose to attack with Subtlety instead of Exactitude when the attack is made with a melee weapon which is either Short or Precise. Also, every such attack gains the same Advantage as if the opponent was surprised.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character presents a false weakness in their defense and tricks the opponent into attacking that weakness. The character can choose to defend themself with Subtlety instead of Agility.

Master<br>Active. With a successful roll against \[Subtlety←Vigilance\] the character can surprise an enemy in the middle of an ongoing fight. A successful test gives the character a Free Attack against that enemy in addition to their ordinary attack. The character may still perform an ordinary attack even if the attempted Feint fails.

## Flailer
`APG`
The character has studied the secrets of the jointed weapons and learned to make full use of their potential.

Novice<br>Passive. In the character's hands, a jointed weapon gains the quality Ensnaring, and may therefore be used to ensnare an enemy, instead of for making a normal attack.

Adept<br>Passive. The character can put great force into the secondary damage of jointed weapons; such hits now deal 1D8 damage, instead of 1D6.

Master<br>Active. The master flailer can use a jointed weapon to continue to strike even after having hit a target. The character may perform attacks against all enemies within range of melee; each attack is rolled separately.

## Hammer Rhythm
`APG`
As a weapon, the hammer is ancient and its brutal simplicity may in the right hands pound forth a deadly rhythm echoing over the battlefield.

The character is one of those who, through training and experience, can utilize the force of the hammer, whether in its single-handed or heavy version.

Novice<br>Reaction. The character can crush the enemy's shield with the hammer. After a failed attack roll where the opponent defends with a shield (that is, the enemy parries the character's attack), the character may roll a \[Might←Agility\]. If successful, a wooden shield shatters to splinters while a metal shield is torn from the opponent's arm and dropped. The shield carrier also suffers 1D6 damage from the heavy blow.

Adept<br>Reaction. When an enemy successfully defends against a hammer attack, the character can grip the shaft of the hammer with both hands and use it to ram the enemy. A passed \[Might←Might\] test drives the opponent one step backwards, and in the space that opens up, the adept hammer fighter gets to make a Free Attack against the enemy.

Master<br>Active. The character makes two hammer attacks against the same target, in one action. If the victim successfully defends against any of these, the master may perform a hammer ram as described at the adept level. Only one ramming per turn is allowed, even if the opponent defends against both attacks.

## Hunter's Instinct
`APG`
Only available to Hunters
Hunters have a finely tuned instinct and when it comes down to it there are few targets – be they criminal, beast or sorcerer – who can avoid the hunter's projectiles.

Novice<br>Special. The hunter appoints a target in sight and gets a second chance to succeed with all ranged attacks against it. The target is appointed when the character makes an attack against it, and the effect lasts till the prey dies or the scene ends.

Adept<br>Passive. The hunter's ranged attacks against an appointed target deal +1D4 damage.

Master<br>Reaction. The master hunter lets no prey escape. The character gets a ranged Free Attack at an appointed target as soon as it moves. This happens every time the target uses a movement action to get from one place to another; a target using both actions for movement provokes two ranged Free Attacks from the character.

## Iron Fist
The character is trained to use their strength for maximum effect on a target in melee combat.

Novice<br>Passive. The character can fully utilize their strength and therefore uses Might instead of Exactitude when making melee attacks.

Adept<br>Passive. The character's melee attacks now deal 1D4 additional damage.

Master<br>Active. The character knows how to truly put their back into an attack. The character can perform a devastating melee attack once per turn that deals +1D8, instead of +1D4, additional damage.

## Knife Connoisseur
`APG, previously Knife Play`
A special fighting technique to be employed wherever combat is waged in restricted spaces.

Knife Connoisseur may only be performed with knife-like weapons, i.e. sticking or cutting weapons with the quality Short.

Novice<br>Passive. The character can choose to attack with Agility instead of Exactitude when attacking with a short, knife-like weapon.

Adept<br>Passive. The character makes two separate knife-attacks at the same target with every combat action. If the character also has Twin Attack, this ability only affects one of the attacks, for a total of three attacks (two with the main hand and one with the other).

Master<br>Reaction. The character can fight effectively with a knife at very short range from the enemy: when the character deals damage with a knife-attack, they are assumed to be so close that the enemy has a hard time using ordinary weapons effectively (the character has two chances to pass the Defense test), and is unable to attack with Long weapons. To reach a better distance, the enemy has to…

… win the initiative next turn (see Quick Strike on page 99 or Take the Initiative on page 104) and then continue attacking until the knife-fighter hits again.

… use a movement action to withdraw from melee, and then suffer a Free Attack from the knife-fighter. If the Free Attack deals damage, the enemy once again finds themself at too short of a distance to attack effectively.

## Leader
There are many who fight their way to a position of leadership, but there are few who are recognized as true leaders by the people they are meant to lead. If equipped with this ability the character is an inspiring, charismatic, and eloquent person whom others listen to and follow, sometimes to their death.

Outside of combat, the Leader ability can be useful to seize command over a group of strangers, organize a militia and the like.

Novice<br>Passive. Due to their strong personality, the character can use Charisma in place of Resolve, for instance when weaving mystical powers, though not as a basis for the corruption threshold.

Adept<br>Active. The character can nominate a creature or an object to be the focused target of their allies for the duration of a scene. All allies who attack that target inflict 1D4 additional damage with each hit. Changing the target requires a new active Action from the Leader.

Master<br>Active. The Leader gives a rousing speech to their allies, allowing them to use their Charisma instead of their own Resolve for the duration of a scene.

## Loremaster`?`
The character is educated and well-versed in the ways of the world: its cultures, its history. Through extensive studies a character with this ability knows not only the story of an object but also its properties and applications.

The Loremaster ability also makes the character skilled at researching records and administrative documents, something which might be very useful when faced with those kinds of problems and puzzles.

Novice<br>Free. With a successful Wit test, a Loremaster can figure out the properties of a specific artifact without being bound to it. In the same way, the novice can use Wit to translate a text or understand what is being said in another human language. A character does not need to make a test when uttering simple words and phrases, but a successful roll against Wit is required when trying to have a proper conversation.

Adept<br>Free. The character is a cultivated scholar of artifacts – in cases when an artifact power is activated by a simple attribute test, the adept can roll against Wit instead of whichever attribute is specified in the description of the power. Also, with a successful Wit test, the adept can read and understand the ungainly tongues of both elves and trolls. To say simple phrases in Elvish or Troll Tongue requires no test, but to initiate a conversation requires a successful roll against Wit.

Master<br>Free. As an acknowledged interpreter of scrolls, the character may with a successful roll against Wit activate mystical powers directly from scrolls and parchments. The Loremaster may also use Wit instead of Resolve to resist mystical effects. Furthermore, the master is familiar with the secrets of Symbaroum. A successful Wit test is required to be able to read a text written in its ancient and extinct language. It requires no test to utter simple phrases, but to initiate a conversation requires a successful roll against Wit.

## Man-at-arms
A real warrior wears armor and is trained in how to move and fight while doing so. No matter what the armor is made from, be it leather, steel or any other material, the Man-at-arms ability gives the character increased protection against hostile strikes and blows.

Novice<br>Passive. The character knows how to use their armor for maximum effect, which increases the armor's Armor tier by one step: light armor protects 1D6, medium armor protects 1D8 and heavy armor protects 1D10.

Adept<br>Passive. The character is used to wearing armor and can adapt their actions to its limitations. The armor no longer has a negative effect on Agility or abilities based on Agility (including Defense). The Impeding quality of the armor still has a negative effect when using mystical powers.

Master<br>Reaction. The character may roll against Agility to counteract effects from Abilities or equipment that make enemy attacks ignore or reduce its Armor value; if the test is successful the Armor protects as usual. Mystical powers that ignore Armor may not be blocked this way; they are not affected by the Man-at-arms ability.

## Mantle Dance
`APG`
Only available to Gentleman Thief
Among fencers, shields are regarded as awkward and barbaric, making the parrying dagger a more fashionable tool for defense. Another school has gone one step further and developed elegant techniques that turn the fencer's mantle into a dancing shield.

The character may use their free hand along with a mantle or similar sheet of cloth in Defense. When used by the character, the sheet becomes a sweeping and hypnotic shield that can confuse or temporarily blind the opponent.

Novice<br>Passive. The character's mantle, or some similar sheet of cloth held in the hand, gives a +1 bonus to Defense.

Adept<br>Active. The mantle strikes at the enemy's eyes, temporarily blinding the target if the attack roll is successful. The character immediately gains a Free Attack against the target, an attack that the enemy must defend against as if blinded. Everyone attacking the blind target can take advantage of the situation for the duration of one turn.

Master<br>Active. In the master's hands, the mantle is like a whip with the quality Ensnaring, making it possible to use it to trap the target. See the quality Ensnaring on page 118 for details.

## Marksman
The character can inflict serious damage on their enemies with a bow or crossbow, hoping to either bring them down or at least make sure that they do not reach those of the character's allies that are equipped for melee combat.

Novice<br>Passive. Thanks to the character's skill, their damage dealt with bows and crossbows is increased to 1D10 and 1D12 respectively, from the usual 1D8 and 1D10.

Adept<br>Active. The character's precision grants their projectiles a crippling effect. The attack deals damage as usual and if the target is wounded the character may make an \[Exactitude←Might\] test every time the target attempts to move. A successful test means that the target cannot move and their Movement Action is forfeit. As soon as the target manages to move (the character fails the test), the crippling effect is gone.

Master<br>Active. The master marksman's projectiles become piercing. The shot hits a weak spot and completely ignores the target's Armor.

## Medicus
The character is schooled in the art of healing and therefore is a great asset in their society, whether they keep diseases from spreading, takes care of wounded warriors or tends to the ruling elite.

A character with the Medicus ability can diagnose and cure diseases and identify a poison by its symptoms. Medicus also gives the character a coroner's point of view, which might come in handy when examining a crime scene or a dead body.

Novice<br>Active. As a clever surgeon, the character can make a test against Wit to heal 1D4 of a patient's Toughness, or 1D6 when using an herbal cure. This ability can only be used once per patient and once per day.

Adept<br>Active. The character is an acknowledged Medicus. A successful Wit test heals 1D6 of a patient's Toughness, or 1D8 when using an herbal cure. This ability can only be used once per patient and once per day.

Master<br>Active. The master Medicus has a vast medical knowledge. A successful Wit test now heals 1D8 Toughness, or 1D10 when using an herbal cure. Even a failed test heals some of the patient's Toughness; 1D4 when only using Medicus or 1D6 when also applying an herbal cure. This ability can only be used once per patient and once per day.

## Natural Warrior
Weapons are not always available or practical. Through long and hard training, the character has become a dangerous opponent even when unarmed.

Novice<br>Passive. The character has learned to use their natural-born warrior capabilities with great efficiency. The character's unarmed attacks now deal 1D6 damage. If the creature has the Natural Weapons trait as well, then the damage is further increased according to the level of that monstrous trait.

Adept<br>Active. With the speed of an adept, the character may now perform a double attack against a single target. The two attacks are rolled separately.

Master<br>Passive. By attacking an opponent's weak points with flawless precision – such as throat and knees – the master's unarmed strikes are truly devastating. Each attack that hits deals 1D6 extra damage.

## Opportunist
`APG`
In the mid of battle, weak spots become exposed and can be exploited. The character has learned how to make use of such opportunities.

Novice<br>Reaction. The character has a second chance to succeed on Free Attacks gained from the enemy withdrawing from melee.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character may use active abilities on Free Attacks gained from the enemy withdrawing from melee. If used, this cancels out the second chance to succeed granted by the novice level.

Master<br>Reaction. When an enemy withdraws from melee, the master opportunist both gains a second chance to succeed with and is allowed to use active abilities on the Free Attack roll.

## Poisoner
The character is familiar with the effective use of poisoned weapons in combat.

The Poisoner ability can be used to identify different poisons or the effect of a poison on a wounded or dead person.

Novice<br>Free. As a free action, the character can apply one dose of poison or any other alchemical elixir to a weapon. That one dose of poison is enough for one hit with the weapon before more of the poison must be applied. A \[Wit←Might\] test is needed for the poison to take effect; if successful the victim starts to take damage. The damage suffered per turn and the duration of the poison depends on its strength (see page 153).

Adept<br>Free. As novice, but the character understands how to make a dose of poison last an entire battle. After applying a dose, all attacks counts as poisonous for the duration of the combat scene.

Master<br>Free. The character has mastered the art of poisoning and knows how to get the most out of a poison. If the character succeeds with a Wit test, any poison applied to a weapon counts as one level higher than usual. Weak poison counts as Moderate, Moderate counts as Strong. Strong poison does not deal any additional damage but gives the character a second chance to succeed with the \[Wit←Might\] test instead.

## Polearm Mastery
The character is initiated in the secrets of longshafted weapons. The spear is a simple weapon and anyone can quickly learn how to make good use of its length. The character's advanced skill with long weapons shows that a simple shaft of hardened wood can be a fearsome weapon in the hands of a trained warrior.

Novice<br>Passive. The damage dealt by Long weapons is increased one step, to 1D10 for spears and halberds and to 1D8 for staves.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character has truly mastered the long thrust. The character receives a Free Attack against all enemies who come into range of melee combat – whether it is the enemy who engages the character or vice versa is irrelevant. The only exception is when the enemy also wields a long weapon; in such a situation the character receives no Free Attack.

Master<br>Reaction. As a Master of long weapons, the character has the skill to keep their enemies at bay. The character can use the Free Attack with a polearm to keep an enemy from coming close enough to attack. For as long as the character succeeds in hitting the enemy, the enemy remains unable to attack the character with melee weapons – whether or not the damage penetrates the enemy's armor.

### The defensive strength of Polearm Mastery
If you want a strongly defensive character, then Polearm Mastery is not a bad option. The adept level provides Free Attacks against any enemy who attempts to come close, which is very good in a fight against multiple opponents. The master level of Polearm Mastery is one of the most powerful abilities in terms of holding enemies in check. But also note that an enemy armed with a polearm more or less cancels the effect of Polearm Mastery.

## Principle Lore
`originally Beast Lore`
The character is learned in the lore of principles and knows many secrets. Many monsters possess special abilities and unique attacks as well as weaknesses which are good to know about when trying to bring them down. At higher levels the character must pick a specialization – Abominations, Beasts, Cultural Beings or Undead – and receives further advantages against members of that specific category.

A character with Beast Lore can identify the tracks of many monsters and beings, and use that information to draw conclusions regarding the size and general behavior of the creature – is it hunting, on the run or just passing through?

Novice<br>Free. The character has studied monsters and can make a Wit test to recognize or recollect a monster's strengths and weaknesses. The Game Master describes the monster and its statistics to the player.

Adept<br>Free. The character is an acknowledged scholar that has been studying a particular sub-category of monsters (pick Abominations, Beasts, Cultural Beings or Undead). The character now deals 1D4 additional damage to monsters from that category. This extra damage applies to the character's allies as well, if they have been instructed in how best to fight the creature.

Master<br>Free. The character now deals 1D6 extra damage to creatures from the sub-category that the player picked at the adept level. This extra damage applies to the character's allies as well, if they have been instructed in how best to fight the creature.

### Monster categories
Abominations
The horrible twisted life forms unique to Davokar.

Beasts
All animals and creatures that belong to nature, such as wolves, reptiles and spider-like pests.

Cultural Beings
Humans, elves, changelings, ogres, goblins and trolls, for example.

Undead
All manner of restless dead, such as ghosts and dragouls of any kind.

## Pyrotechnics
`APG`
Only available to Queen's Spy
In Ambria, advances within the field of alchemy have led to the use of alchemical weapons. The secret agents of the Queen are known to employ such devices when combating the enemies of the realm or escaping from hazardous situations. The character can use special elixirs to blind or otherwise weaken the enemy. Note that the master level of the ability Sixth Sense makes it possible to act normally despite being blinded; Sixth Sense does not affect any other effects from Pyrotechnics.

Novice<br>Active. The character can use Flash Powder created by an alchemist to dazzle an opponent in melee combat. This requires an \[Exactitude←Agility\] test; the attack deals 1D4 damage (ignoring armor) and the target is blinded for 1D4 turns. The character can also handle alchemical grenades and alchemical mines without risking a catastrophic failure.

Adept<br>Active. The character can use an alchemical Smoke Bomb correctly to fill an area with dense smoke. If the Smoke Bomb is thrown at a distance, an Exactitude test is needed for it to land where intended. If dropped at the character's feet no test is needed, but the character is affected just like all others in the vicinity. Everyone in the area, friends and enemies, are blinded until they leave the place (two movement actions in any direction). Those remaining in the smoke must pass a Might test each turn or suffer 1D4 damage, ignoring armor, from smoke poisoning.

Master<br>Active. The character can effectively activate and throw an alchemical Thunder Ball at a group of enemies. All targets within a radius of five meters are hit, an \[Exactitude←Agility\] test decides if they suffer whole or half damage. The damage is 1D12, ignoring armor. Furthermore, all targets suffering from the full effect are blinded for 1D4 turns.

## Quick Draw
Dealing the first blow can decide the outcome of a battle, and with this ability the character has an advantage when an unexpected ambush happens. The character also becomes a much more dynamic warrior, able to quickly switch weapons to meet the demands of any situation – a skill particularly appreciated among barbarian skirmishers and Ambrian archers.

Novice<br>Free. With a successful test against Agility, the character may unsheathe and draw a weapon as a Free Action, thereby being able to use the weapon as if it was already drawn. The character can also reload a crossbow as a Free Action with a successful Agility Test.

Adept<br>Free. With a successful Agility test, the character may switch weapons as a Free Action, meaning that the character can sheathe one weapon and draw another in one fluid motion.

Master<br>Free. The character handles elixirs swiftly and may with a successful Agility test pour one dose down their own or someone else's throat as a Free Action.

## Rapid Fire
`APG`
Archers in Ambria and Davokar have developed techniques for rapid firing. In essence, if right-handed, they place the arrow on the right side of the bow instead of on the left, and draw several arrows at a time from the quiver to hold them in the left hand. This way, arrows may be knocked, aimed and fired in a single motion, meaning that they can be launched one after the other – truly bad news for poorly armored targets.

The ability requires that some kind of bow be used in combat.

Novice<br>Active. The character can sacrifice their movement action to fire a second arrow, two in total. This may only be done if the combat action is also used for firing a bow. The arrows are rolled separately and may (but do not have to) be aimed at the same target.

Adept<br>Active. The character may fire two arrows with a single combat action, at one or two different targets.

Master<br>Active. The character fires three arrows with a single combat action, at one or two different targets.

## Rapid Reflexes
`APG`
Only available to Rogues
Rogues do not have much in common, besides that they all are survivalists – either because they are quite fond of being alive or in order for them to keep striving for their goals. This will to stay alive has resulted in the development of various ways to avoid being damaged.

Novice<br>Reaction. In situations when the character suffers from an effect which may result in full or half damage (for instance from alchemical grenades and Brimstone Cascade), the character suffers half damage instead of full, and no damage instead of half. As an example, if hit by a Brimstone Cascade that normally deals 1D12 with a hit and 1D6 with a miss, this is transformed into 1D6 with a hit and no damage at all with a miss.

Adept<br>Reaction. The rogue avoids the enemy's melee attack and dances around to their back; with a passed Defense test, the rogue and the enemy switch places, if the player wishes. This means that the rogue gets away from being flanked without suffering a Free Attack, and also that the enemy ends up in a flanked position if there was an ally standing next to the rogue.

Master<br>Free. The expert rogue's reflexes are so finely tuned that they ignore the usual turn order and always acts first; only others with this ability and a higher value in Agility or Vigilance gets to go before the rogue.

## Recovery
Among both Black Cloaks and Mystics, meditative techniques that provide strange bodily capabilities have been developed. The character can use their inner power reserves with an almost magical self-discipline to rejuvenate the energy of their body, even when in the midst of combat.

Novice<br>Active. With a successful die roll against Resolve, the character regains 1D4 Toughness. Multiple attempts can be made, but only one successful attempt is allowed per day.

Adept<br>Active. Just as novice level, but the character recovers 1D6 Toughness.

Master<br>Active. Just as adept level, but the character recovers 1D8 Toughness.

## Rider
`previously Equestrian`
It takes training to be able to use a mount in combat, both for the rider and the mount, but if they are able to work together as one, they become a deadly combination.

A character with the Rider ability also has a good hand with other kinds of farm animals and the like, and can therefore use the ability to calm agitated beasts, for instance keeping watch dogs from barking.

Novice<br>Reaction. The character is an experienced rider and used to fighting while mounted. The character knows how to use the weight of the mount in a cavalry charge and deals 1D6 additional damage with one melee attack if the mount moves prior to the attack.

Adept<br>Active. The bond between a mount and their rider makes it possible for them to make sweeping attacks, meaning that they use parts of their Move Action before an attack, and the rest afterwards. This way, they are able to perform a melee attack without being locked into melee combat. The enemy can only retaliate by using Reactions, or by spending their Movement Action trying to catch up with the rider.

Master<br>Reaction. The master rider can use a cavalry charge even more effectively and therefore deals +1D10 damage with one melee attack if the mount moves prior to the attack.

## Rune Tattoo
`APG`
The rune crafters of Clan Vajvod in eastern Davokar often tattoo themselves and their allies with powerful runes. These runes seem almost alive and glow red-hot when activated in combat. The character carries such tattoos, either self-made (requires the ritual Carve Rune Tattoo) or granted to the character as a gift or a reward, likely for a service of great importance for the symbolist who made it.

Rune Tattoo requires that someone uses the ritual Carve Rune Tattoo on the character. If the character has the ability from the start, the tattoo is already in place.

Novice<br>Reaction. The rune tattoo provides a +1D4 bonus to armor against attacks, but only if the character chooses to activate it. Activating the effect costs one temporary corruption for each attack that hits and the character decides whether or not to use it before they roll for other kinds of armor. In addition, the rune protects from weather and wind like a full set of clothes.

Adept<br>Reaction. The rune tattoo is attracted to injuries on the character's body and glows around the wounds. The character regenerates one point of Toughness per turn; each point healed costs one point in temporary corruption. The tattooed warrior may abort the regeneration process when they wish.

Master<br>Reaction. The rune tattoo adds power to the warrior's attacks. When an enemy is hit and the character so wishes, the glowing tattoo flows over the weapon dealing +1D4 damage, at the cost of as many points in temporary corruption for the character.

## Shield Fighter
The character is trained in how to make good use of a shield, and how to actively fight using the shield as a weapon. Behind the protection of the shield, the character can generate a great momentum to fuel their attacks, as well as strike with the shield itself. This is an effective combination which probably explains why it is so common among both barbarian and Ambrian warriors.

The buckler, the light shield usually utilized by archers, is too light to be used with the Shield Fighter ability. The warrior has to carry a sturdy shield made of either wood or steel to generate the required amount of force.

Novice<br>Passive. The damage dealt by weapons held in the character's sword arm is increased by one step; to 1D10 if the character fights with a single-handed weapon or to 1D8 if using a Short weapon. The novice Shield Fighter also wields their shield as an instrument of protection with greater efficiency and therefore receives a +2 Defense bonus instead of the usual +1 when using a shield.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character has learned how to combine weapon and shield so well that every successful attack may be followed up by a shield bash against the same target (separate attack roll). If it hits, the damage of the shield bash is 1D4, and should the shield fighter make a successful test against \[Might←Might\] the target is also knocked to the ground.

Master<br>Reaction. The damage of the shield bash is increased from 1D4 to 1D8 and the target is knocked to the ground if the character succeeds with a \[Might←Might\] test.

## Siege Expert
`APG`
In Ambria, wars are fought in two ways: on the battlefield and through sieges. Siege weapons are used in both cases. This ability covers the use of ballistae, siege towers and catapults, and also the skill to construct these contraptions from the ground up. A siege expert can plan and organize the digging of protective trenches and tunnels for the purpose of undermining an enemy's walls. Added to this is the use of alchemical battlefield weapons: alchemical grenades, breaching pots, missile batteries and alchemical fire tubes, both stationary and portable.

All siege and battlefield weapons are described in the Weapons' section, starting on page 110.

Novice<br>Special. The character is trained to use a ballista and to construct siege towers on location. The character can handle alchemical grenades and does not risk them detonating by mistake, like an inexperienced user must worry about.

Adept<br>Special. The character can lead the work when building and then effectively use more advanced siege weapons, like the catapult and its bigger cousin, the trebuchet. At the site of a siege, the character can plan and lead the work of digging protective trenches and undermining tunnels. The character has learned the deeper secrets regarding the art of siege weapons – alchemical smoke screens hiding attacking troops from hostile archers; the use of the alchemical breaching pot that blasts holes in the enemy's fortifications; and the alchemical fire tube, spewing fire and death at anyone passing in front of it. Also, the portable version of the alchemical fire tube can safely be handled under stress, without risking catastrophic failures.

Master<br>Special. The character's understanding of alchemical weapons is exceptional, and they all get the quality Massive if they do not have it already.

## Sixth Sense
When moving through dark forests and underground tunnels, one's eyes are no longer very useful. Lighting a lantern or torch may summon dangers, so the explorer had better learn to rely on their other senses. With dedicated training it is possible to awaken these other senses and sharpen them to the brink of eeriness. The Sixth Sense ability provides the character with unique capabilities when fighting at a distance or in situations where eyesight can no longer be trusted.

A character with Sixth Sense may under calm circumstances navigate unhindered in dim light, as well as maintain a sense of direction in complete darkness, though at a pace of only a quarter of their normal, daytime speed. 

Novice<br>Passive. The character has a strong intuition, which lets them use Vigilance instead of Exactitude when attacking with ranged weapons.

Adept<br>Passive. The character's intuition has expanded and the character may now use Vigilance instead of Agility for Initiative and when calculating their Defense.

Master<br>Passive. The character can move and fight unhindered when blinded or in complete darkness.

## Staff Fighting
`APG`
The apparent simplicity of the staff tends to mask its versatility as a weapon, which is demonstrated by skilled staff fighters, often found among Davokar's elves and the ascetic staff mages who use their rune staffs for fighting if the situation demands it. There are also staff fighters among the barbarians, often using the Pike Axe as a weapon (the same weapon called a Halberd in Ambria). The question of whether or not these fighting traditions have a common origin is redundant; they are all equally effective – something a character with this ability will be able to demonstrate.

Staff Fighting may be performed with all Long weapons – staff, spear, halberd and pike. Also the more exotic Chain Staff can be used. Moreover, staff fighting techniques are especially useful for anyone using them with the simplest of all Long weapons – the wooden staff.

Novice<br>Reaction. The character is trained to parry incoming attacks and gains +1 in Defense; with the simple wooden staff or a rune staff – quicker and better balanced than other weapons in the category – the bonus is +2 in Defense.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character uses the back end of the Long weapon to gain a Free Attack if the opponent defends against the initial attack. The Free Attack is rolled separately and the damage is 1D6. If armed with a wooden staff (that is, not a spear or a halberd, but including rune staffs), this may also be done after every successful Defense against melee attacks while holding the weapon – the staff fighter makes a quick riposte after having parried.

Master<br>Active. The character has learned how to target the legs and then attack the fallen enemy with a single motion. The initial attack sends the enemy to the ground if the attacker succeeds with a \[Exactitude←Agility\] test and the follow-up is performed as a Free Attack with Advantage on the opponent.

## Staff Magic
`APG`
Only available to Staff Mages
The staff mages were once the guards of the Symbarian emperor. After the fall of the last emperor, they retreated to their castle deep inside Davokar, hoping to reform their weakened order. To them, they were to blame for the fall of Symbaroum; they failed in their duty because they focused more on titles, intrigues and status than on protecting the empire.

The reformation gave birth to the order as it is today, its members appearing as simply dressed and taciturn mystics with astounding powers. The character is one of the chosen, given a rune staff and the task of restoring the former grandeur of the order by crushing the darkness and placing the rightful heir of the last emperor on the Throne of Thorns in Symbar.

The staff mages are an elite order, placing high demands on recruits from the start; only the most promising mystics can ever hope to battle darkness as members of their order.

Novice<br>Special. The staff mage binds their soul to a rune staff, carved with the runes of the elements. The staff absorbs all corruption the character would have gained by learning the powers of the tradition at the novice level. If the character already has permanent corruption when being bound to the staff, the level of permanent corruption is reduced by 1D6. This can only be done once; if the staff gets lost or must be replaced, no additional reduction is made. In addition, as a free action the staff mage can activate an elemental rune and then deal +1D4 damage with the staff, no matter if it is used in combination with the powers of the tradition or as a melee weapon. The character can chose between fire, lightning, cold or acid. Activating the rune gives no corruption.

Adept<br>Special. The staff absorbs all corruption the character would have gained by learning the powers of the tradition at the adept level. Also, the staff binds the corruption so well that the character gets a second chance to roll for corruption when using all powers included in the tradition; the character suffers from the lower of the two outcomes.

Master<br>Special. The staff absorbs all corruption the character would have gained by learning the powers of the tradition at the master level. The staff also binds temporary corruption so effectively, that the character no longer suffers any temporary corruption when using the powers of staff magic.

## Steadfast
Mental disciplines and stratagems for resisting improper influences have been developed among the ranks of the Templars and Black Cloaks. Also among Mystics there are individuals who study the art of resistance.

The character has a mind as hard as steel, inspiring it to fight on even against insurmountable odds. Mystics rarely succeed when trying to hurt or seize control of the character's senses, and sometimes a truly steadfast character manages to defend themself mentally and even turn the magic back on the hostile mystic.

Novice<br>Reaction. The character can make a second attempt to succeed with a Might or Resolve test when trying to break an ongoing physical effect from, for instance, traps or alchemical elixirs. This includes energies from mystical powers, as long as these are manifested physically in the forms of fire, acid or similar.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character is unshakable, and can make a second attempt to shrug off ongoing powers that affects either their will or their senses.

Master<br>Reaction. The psyche of the character strikes back against anyone who tries to affect it. Whenever the character is the victim of a mental attack (in other words, those attacks that are modified by Resolve) that fails, the attacker suffers 1D6 damage that ignores Armor.

## Steel Throw
There are traditions and groups whose representatives have practiced the art of the thrown weapon for generations. Throwing knives are for instance common among thieves and thugs in the cities, and in the woods many clan warriors are equipped with throwing axes or spears. In fact, most barbarian fighters (especially those within the clan of Zarek) regularly use throwing weapons as part of their combat tactics, unleashing a shower of steel just before they charge into the fray.

Novice<br>Passive. The character has begun to understand the riddle of steel-throwing. The damage dealt by throwing weapons is increased to 1D8.

Adept<br>Active. The character can perform a double throw with one Action. The attacks are rolled separately and are either aimed at the same target, or at two different ones. The character can also use melee weapons as throwing weapons, but can only throw one such weapon per Action. The damage for this kind of attack is the base damage of the melee weapon, including any passive abilities that the thrower might have.

Master<br>Active. The character can unleash a devastating triple throw and send three throwing weapons towards their enemies, all of them against a single target or distributed among multiple ones.

## Strangler
The character has been initiated into the dirty, but sometimes necessary, art of strangulation. This fighting technique has a bad reputation among Ambrians and barbarians alike, but that does not mean that it is not widely desired by those who want enemies or their guards discreetly taken care of.

With this ability the character can do a lot of damage to an unprepared or slow enemy with either a garrote or, if more advanced, with the alchemical Choking Spores.

Novice<br>Active. The novice Strangler may attack when at an Advantage. A successful attack deals 1D6 damage each turn and ignores Armor. The target cannot act until the Strangler's hold is aborted; the character maintains the stranglehold with a successful \[Wit←Wit\].

Adept<br>Active. The character knows how to use the deadly Choking Spores, gathered deep within Davokar by alchemists. With a successful \[Wit←Agility\], the spores are thrown at an enemy and deal 1D4 damage per turn for 1D4 turns, ignoring Armor. There is no known countermeasure against the effect of the Choking Spores, other than healing the victim when the damage appears. Affected victims may act as usual, in contrast to the novice level of this ability.

Master<br>Active. The character can use the delicate and lethal Spore Bombs created from Choking Spores by master alchemists. If thrown over a distance, it requires a successful Wit test for the bomb to land on the intended spot. The Spore Bomb fills a corridor, a smaller area or an ordinary room with a suffocating cloud. Anyone who stands within that area, enemies as well as allies, are affected by the Choking Spores, which ignore Armor and deal 1D4 damage per turn for a duration of 1D4 turns.

## Strong Gift
`APG`
Only available to Mystics
There are many myths describing the origin of mystical powers, and all established traditions are quick to state that theirs is the oldest, or at least nearly as old as the mystical practice itself. Whatever the truth may be, many believe that it was self-taught mystics with an especially perfected or strong gift who founded the first traditions.

The Strong Gift – innate or acquired through trials and practice – can still be found with some mystics. For one thing, the gift provides a singular resistance against the corruption of the world. It also endows the mystic with the ability to use improvised mystical powers, at a high cost in corruption.

Novice<br>Special. The Strong Gift allows the character to choose a signature power. This power is selected from among the ones already known to the mystic, and that power then only costs one (1) temporary corruption to use. If the character has no powers or just prefers to have a tainting ability as their signature instead, this is also allowed – a gift linked to the ability Ritualist (including all individual rituals) or to Sublime Sight means that these never cost more than one temporary corruption to use. Also, traits such as Wisdom of the Ages may be chosen. The Strong Gift has no effect on the cost in permanent corruption for learning a power outside a mystical tradition; it only affects the amount of temporary corruption gained when using it.

Adept<br>Passive. A character with the adept level in Strong Gift uses their whole Resolve value as the corruption threshold, instead of only half. Such an individual does not become blight born until their total corruption reaches a value of Resolve ×2

Master<br>Special. The gift of the Master lets the character cast any mystical power, albeit only at the novice level. There is a second chance to fail all success tests and using the power causes 1D8 temporary corruption. All mystical powers are available, no matter what tradition they belong to.

## Sword Saint
`APG`
Sword Saints have achieved an almost mystic symbiosis with their fencing swords, who handle their weapons as if they were extensions of their body and soul. The Sword Saint techniques may only be used with a fencing sword (or other single-handed sword with the quality Balanced). A parrying dagger or the ability Mantle Dance may also be used in combination with the sword, but Sword Saint cannot be combined with the ability Twin Attack to gain additional bonuses to damage.

Novice<br>Passive. The character has learned to take full advantage of fighting with a balanced sword in one hand and a parrying dagger in the other. The damage dealt by the sword is 1D10, instead of 1D8.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character can perform a rapid riposte. After one successful Defense per turn, the character gains a Free Attack against the enemy.

Master<br>Reaction. The master can perform a series of ripostes and gains a Free Attack against the opponent with each successful Defense test, with no limitation on the number of Free Attacks per turn. As a Passive addition, the damage of the balanced sword increases to 1D12.

## Symbolism
`APG`
Symbolism was developed in the east, beyond the Ravens, in what the symbolists call “The first city of humans” – a place of myth, lost somewhere in the vast deserts of the eastern wastes. Nowadays, the symbolists gather in Vajvod, in eastern Davokar, even though some of them travel far and wide in their search for knowledge of runes, signs and symbols. The basic assumption of the symbolists states that the world consists of signs and symbols, and that it therefore may be affected and influenced by altering signs and symbols which represent its diverse features.

The powers of Symbolism are created by drawing or writing. More fanciful procedures are also possible, like embroidery, etchings or weaves. Procedures aside, the power of the symbol is released by the symbolist's command, and the symbol vaporizes when its power has been unleashed. Creating a symbol gives no corruption but when it is activated the one who uses it suffers one (1) point of temporary corruption.

Novice<br>Special. The character has begun to grasp the power of runes. The signs must be physically represented – carved, painted, etched, tattooed – which takes time; for a novice, it takes one hour to create a power symbol. However, it only takes a combat action to activate a symbol, which is done by uttering an activation phrase. Note that the symbolist has to see or be in direct contact (melee range) with the symbol in order to activate it. The symbolist can only have one symbol per mystical power prepared in this way. When a symbol has been used it must be recharged, which takes as much time as it does to create the symbol from scratch.

Adept<br>Special. With a combat action, the symbolist can quickly paint a symbol in a book or draw it in the mud or dust of the ground. These temporary symbols transcend the limitation stating that the symbolist may only have one symbol per power prepared. To the adept, activating symbols – no matter if they are prepared in a more permanent fashion (see novice) or are of a temporary nature – is a free action where they only have to utter a single word. However, only one symbol may be activated per turn.

In addition, the adept symbolist can choose to activate symbols using a physical trigger instead of a word. The trigger is decided by the mystic when the symbol is created, and can for instance be that a living creature enters a room, that someone steps on the symbol or that a weapon is drawn within melee range. The symbolist may or may not exclude themself from this equation, but the allies of the symbolist cannot be excluded: if they act in accordance with the trigger, the symbol is activated.

The adept can erase one of his or her own symbols with a simple gesture (free action), but this requires actually touching the symbol.

Master<br>Active. As a combat action, the symbolist can draw flaming power runes in the air and activate them as part of the same action. Hence, the symbols work just like the powers of other traditions, aside from the mystic only suffering one point in temporary corruption per activation. These momentary symbols transcend the limitation stating that the symbolist may only have one symbol per power prepared.

## Tactician
According to Ambrians, scholarly knowledge is counted as one of the highest virtues. Hence, it is hardly surprising that Ambrian scholars have studied skirmishes meticulously to see if the tactics of battles can work on a lesser scale, among smaller groups and even in duels. The result is a style of combat governed by strict principles and calculations, which over time can out-maneuver even the most aggressive attacker. The character is trained in this scholarly warrior tradition.

A schooled tactician may also use this ability to analyze a tactical approach and find both its strengths and weaknesses. This can be done for offensive purposes when facing a hostile group or defensively, to establish a strong defense.

Novice<br>Passive. The character has studied the tactics of warfare and grasped its fundamental principles. The character may use Wit instead of Agility when calculating their Initiative.

Adept<br>Passive. The character has mastered the art of a good defensive posture, which allows them to use Wit instead of Agility when calculating Defense.

Master<br>Passive. The character is a genius when it comes to offensive warfare, which allows the character to use Wit instead of Exactitude when attacking with anything but heavy weapons.

## Trapper
`APG`
Traps have been used since ancient times and in Davokar they are particularly useful. Among barbarians, the art of trap-making is known to many and even Ambrians venturing into the woods know to appreciate a good trap. The character has realized that monsters and abominations are best combated after having been caught and fettered.

Trained trappers can deploy and disarm both mechanical traps and alchemical mines. Furthermore, when the need arises, the character can quickly manufacture improvised traps from materials at hand. See more on the rules regarding traps on page 102.

Novice<br>Active. With a passed Wit test, the character can use a combat action to deploy or disarm a mechanical trap. The effect depends on the level of the trap (see page 127 in the Equipment chapter). The character can also build an improvised trap, but this requires a whole turn to complete. An improvised trap made by the character deals 1D6 damage.

Adept<br>Active. The character can handle alchemical mines the same way they handle mechanical traps. An improvised trap made by the character now deals 1D8 damage.

Master<br>Active. The character is a renowned trapper who knows how to make the most of any kind of trap. Traps and mines are counted as one tier higher: weak becomes moderate, moderate becomes strong and the character gets a second chance on all rolls when using a strong device – the enemies' attempts to discover, disarm or get free become more difficult; also the damage dice is rolled twice and the highest outcome stands. For alchemical traps, the damage re-roll only pertains to the initial explosion, not the ongoing damage that follows. Improvised traps now deal 1D10 damage.

Traps and Terrain
The effectiveness of traps is determined by the terrain's limitations and potential. Hence, it is suggested that you use a Combat Map when traps are employed (see page 162 in the Core Rulebook). If Movement by Scale is used, a trap covers one square (see page 181 in the Core Rulebook).

## Trick Archery
`APG`
Trick shooting with bows and crossbows is highest fashion in Ambria, as appreciated at shows as it is effective in combat. Trick archers are not very many, since most people lack the patience for honing their skills to such an astounding degree. The character is one of the few who have dedicated their lives to mastering the bow or the crossbow.

Novice<br>Active. The character can use a full turn (combat plus movement action) to aim perfectly and then hit a very precise location on the enemy; shoot a weapon from a hand, nail a body-part to a nearby wall or tree, or aim for the eyes to blind the enemy. The attack is rolled as usual and if it hits and deals damage, the intended effect also occurs: a weapon is dropped and must be picked up, an arrow that nails the enemy to a wall must be pulled out or broken, and a hit close to the eyes leaves the enemy temporarily blinded. Whichever the case, the target loses a combat action in order to deal with the situation.

Adept<br>Active. The archer can cause projectiles to ricochet off floors, walls, furniture, shields or living creatures with robust skin or armor in order to hit targets behind cover so the character does not need free line of sight before firing. They must have an idea of where the target is or have watched it duck into hiding, for instance into cover or an adjacent room. If the target has made a double movement action it cannot be hit. This kind of attack is made as usual, regarding both success test and damage test.

Master<br>Reaction. Once per turn, the character can parry a successful attack at range. This ranged parrying maneuver can be of two types:

Versus a melee attack aimed at an ally: The master archer fires a projectile that deflects an attack which otherwise would have hit one of their allies. This parrying maneuver requires a passed \[Exactitude←Agility\] test; if successful, the attack misses the ally without dealing any damage.

Versus a physical projectile aimed at the archer or an ally: The parrying maneuver requires a passed \[Exactitude←Agility\] test; if successful, the incoming projectile is deflected and misses its target.

## Troll Singing
`APG`
The mystical tradition of trolls is expressed through singing, sometimes accompanied by music played on horn, flute or pipes. According to the trolls' educational songs, the tradition stems from the kauking singing style that trolls use to communicate over long distances in the Underworld.

Novice<br>Special. The troll singer suffers no permanent corruption from learning troll songs at the novice level, but has no protection from temporary corruption suffered when singing them. In addition, once per scene all troll singers have a second chance to succeed on a test when trying to influence or affect a target's mind (that is, situations when the adversary defends using the attribute Resolve). The re-roll may not be used to create or maintain a chain of mystical effects.

Adept<br>Special. The troll singer suffers no permanent corruption from learning troll songs at the adept level. Additionally, the adept may re-roll one success test when trying to influence or affect a target's mind, also when creating or maintaining a chain of such mystical effects.

Master<br>Special. The troll singer suffers no permanent corruption from learning troll songs at the master level. The master may re-roll every success test when trying to influence or affect a target's mind, also when creating or maintaining a chain of such mystical effects.

## Twin Attack
Barbarians, Ambrians and goblins all have fighting techniques involving the use of more than one weapon. The character has learned how to fight with two weapons, an advanced but effective technique that gives the warrior an offensive advantage. Twin Attack is especially effective against lightly armored targets.

Novice<br>Active. The character can safely wield two weapons, one in each hand. The novice can fight with a single-handed weapon in their primary hand and a Short weapon in the other. The character can make two attacks against the same target, dealing 1D8 and 1D6 damage respectively. The enemy must defend themself separately against the attacks. The novice also receives a +1 bonus to their Defense as a Passive ability, but only when wielding a weapon in each hand.

Adept<br>Active. The adept can use two singlehanded weapons, each attack dealing 1D8 damage.

Master<br>Active. With the skill of a Master, the damage dealt by the main-hand weapon is 1D10 while the weapon in the other hand deals 1D8.

## Two-handed Force
The knights of Ambria as well as the Wrathguards of Karvosti dress themselves in steel from head to toe and have realized that with that much armor, they are free to focus on dealing massive amounts of damage.

Heavy two-handed weapons rest comfortably in the character's callused hands and can have an astoundingly destructive effect on all sorts of targets. Heavy weapons are extra effective against heavily armored enemies.

Novice<br>Passive. The damage dealt by heavy weapons is increased to 1D12.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character has mastered the use of their weapon, so when an attack misses a target the character may instead use the returning swing in an attempt to hit the target again. The character makes a new attack roll, which deals 1D8 damage if it hits.

Master<br>Active. A heavy weapon in the hands of a master is truly a tool of armor-crushing destruction. When the attacks of a master hit the target, they completely ignore the target's Armor.

## Sublime Sight
`originally Witchsight`
By way of the shadows surrounding creatures, locations and objects the world's deeper conflicts are observable for a character with the Sublime Sight ability. Opening up one's mind in order to examine the world of shadows can provide invaluable insights, but it also entails great risk: the more open the mind is and the deeper the insights are, the greater the risk of becoming tainted by the darkness of the world. It is for this reason that masters of this ability seldom use it to their full capacity.

As previously stated, the color of the Shadows can give the character clues regarding the spiritual alliance of the inspected creature (see Shadow & Corruption, page 174). The Game

Master<br>manages the nuances and powers of the Shadows and describes what the character sees with their Sublime Sight.

Novice<br>Free. As a Free Action, the character can make a roll against \[Vigilance←Subtlety\] in an attempt to see the dominant Shadow of a creature, location or object. Each such attempt forces the character to suffer 1 temporary Corruption.

Adept<br>Free. The character has gained the greater insight of an adept regarding auras and mystical phenomenon. Sublime Sight now reveals all Shadows of an inspected target but not their respective strengths. The character suffers 1D4 temporary Corruption each time they attempt to see the Shadows of a creature, location or object.

Master<br>Free. The character has achieved the master's superior insights and can now see all Shadows and their respective strengths clearly. The character suffers 1D6 temporary Corruption each time an attempt is made to see the Shadows of a creature, location or object.

## Wrestling
`APG`
Wrestling is popular among warriors, appreciated for educational purposes as well as its entertainment value. Hence, wrestling matches can be seen in the arenas of Ambria's larger towns, in army camps among bored soldiers and on the battlefield amidst swinging swords and axes. The character is trained to wrestle, both with and without the protection of armor.

The trait Robust adds a bonus to Might when throwing an opponent or resisting being thrown: +2 at novice level, +4 at adept level, +8 at master level. Robust gives no bonus if some other attribute besides Might is used.

Novice<br>Active. The character knows the basic wrestling maneuvers and can use them against armed opponents. Also, the character can wrestle while holding weapons; they need not be dropped or put away. The attack is made as usual and if successful the wrestler gets the enemy in a firm grip. The wrestler may then try to throw the enemy or just maintain the grip; both alternatives require a \[Might←Might\] test. The throw inflicts 1D4 damage, ignoring armor, and leaves the enemy flat on their back. The alternative to a throw, maintaining the grip, inflicts no damage, but the enemy cannot act until the wrestler fails a \[Might←Might\] test. Also, all allies of the wrestler have Advantage on the gripped enemy. The wrestler is unable to do anything else while maintaining the grip, leaving them vulnerable: all enemies have Advantage on the wrestler.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character has learned how to counter an opponent's strength and can use it to throw the enemy to the ground. First, the wrestler must pass a normal Defense test verses the enemy's melee attack, then they must pass a \[Agility←Might\] test. The throw deals 1D4 damage, ignoring armor, and the thrown enemy ends up flat on their back, loses their breath and is unable to perform any active actions during the following turn.

Master<br>Reaction. The reactive throw of the character (see the adept level) only requires a passed \[Agility←Might\] test, no Defense test is needed. If the throw fails, then a Defense test is rolled to avoid being hit. The master's throw deals 1D6 damage, ignoring armor, and the thrown enemy ends up flat on their back, loses their breath and is unable to perform any active actions during the following turn. Furthermore, the master wrestler immediately gets a Free Attack on the enemy.

## Mystical Power
The character has access to one or more mystical powers. These powers have either been obtained as a gift, a curse, through assiduous studies or as a consequence of a deep and dedicated faith. The character's power may have a crux of a [[Principle Bond]] (Appreciation, Captivation, Exaltation, Fear), which all have their benefits and disadvantages. The character may also be a Mystic without a bond, with a homebrewed theory as to where these powers come from and what they are meant for. For more information see Chapter 18: Mystical Traditions (page 126).

Each Mystical Power is its own ability and is purchased separately. For a more detailed description of the different mystical powers, see Chapter 19: Mystical Powers (page 130).

The character suffers one point (1) of permanent Corruption each time they learn a new mystical power. The Corruption can be reduced if the power is part of a mystical tradition that the character belongs to. The character also suffers 1D4 temporary Corruption each time this power is used. Again, the Corruption suffered can be reduced if the power is considered a part of a tradition that the character belongs to (see Shadow & Corruption, page 174).

Novice<br>Special. The character has mastered the power's novice level.

Adept<br>Special. The character has mastered the power's adept level.

Master<br>Special. The character has mastered the power's master level.

## Ritualist
The character has learned how mystical powers can be channeled through rituals – powerful but time-consuming magical practices. This knowledge may come from studying under a teacher or from self-studies with a ritual codex.

The character suffers one (1) permanent Corruption from each ritual it learns, except if the ritual belongs to a mystical tradition practiced by the character. In the latter case the character is spared the blight of Corruption.

When it comes to performing rituals, the character suffers 1D4 temporary Corruption, unless under relevant [[Principle Bond]]. Performing rituals covered by the character's tradition only gives one (1) point of temporary Corruption.

The Ritualist ability makes it possible for the character to recognize what ritual has been performed by examining symbols and components remaining on the scene, and also to deduce the effects of the ritual, even if they have not mastered it.

Novice<br>Special. The character has learned to perform one (1) ritual. The ritual may belong to any mystical tradition, but the character must have access to the ritual in order to learn and memorize it. The knowledge may be gained from a tutor involved in the same organization as the character, from a codex found in the ruins of Symbaroum or from another ritualist who imparts the knowledge as a reward for services rendered.

Adept<br>Special. The character has learned to perform up to two additional rituals (three in total), again from any mystical tradition, but bound to the same conditions as those presented at the novice level.

Master<br>Special. The character has learned to perform up to three additional rituals (six rituals in total). Just as before, the

Master<br>Ritualist is not limited to the rituals of a single mystical tradition, but must have access to the ritual to be able to learn and memorize it.
