> One who fears the principles, magic, and the unknown acquiesces to the immensity of nature and bends its purpose.

Novice
> The novice fearful mystic has a certain dread and diffident ambition that typifies a wont of abstruse effectiveness.

Special. Each time the fearful mystic suffers [[Corruption]], they may roll against Resolve. If they succeed, they only receive one (1) point of Corruption.

Adept
> The adept fearful mystic exudes an air of haunted restlessness, and the world itself takes advantage.

Reaction. A fearful mystic who fails in an attempt to use a power may try again, this time rolling against their Total Corruption value. If this roll is successful, then the mystical power is activated as normal and the mystic suffers an additional 1D4 temporary Corruption.

Master
> A dense fog of boiling shadow seems to seep from the master fearful mystic; the onerous immensity of imperfection and injustice harries the world through the mystic.

Special. Each time the fearful mystic attempts to affect the [[Resolve]] attribute of another creature, they may choose to roll against the creature's Shadow instead (the creatures Resolve â€“Total Corruption). Thoroughly corrupted creatures are strangely immune to this; it is as if they feed off the darkness of the world to carry on with their dark calling.
