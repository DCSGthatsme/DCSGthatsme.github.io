Magic in this world is not a force or a well of power. It is an unfounded potentiality asserted into actuality by the cogency of the mystic. But any bold assertion is subject to rebuttal, and [[Sophistry]] is no exception. [[Corruption]] is the consequent retort to the mystic jarring the inertia of reality.

Principles are paragons of potentiality and actuality; their acts are exceptional yet indisputably apropos. Thus, principles do not incur Corruption. With a Principle's recognition, the mystic may form a bond to Principles, to the unknowable, and to their own role within what is known. This bond carves a unique path between the Sophist's ideations and causations, anchoring them to deeper meanings. With such a bond, the Sophist obtains newfound structure, focus, and definition with certain Sophisms. Ultimately, the Sophist sustains less Corruption from such magic.

There are four distinct bond [[Abilities]]: Appreciation, Captivation, Exaltation, and Fear. For the mystic intending to use magic with frequency, establishing one of these bonds is imperative if they wish to avoid the perils of Corruption.

Once a mystic's Crux is established and a bond is offered, a new bond at novice level costs 10 [[Experience]]. To increase a novice bond to the adept level costs 20 Experience. To increase an adept bond to the master level costs 30 Experience.
