The creature's blood is corrosive, and sprays all around when the creature is hit by attacks. Whoever hits the creature in melee combat, and manages to damage it, must make a Defense test or be hit by the acidic blood. Removing the acid from either body or armor requires that someone spends an Action and makes a successful Wit test (wash it away with water, dirt, sand or something similar).

I<br>Reaction. The acidic blood is weak and deals 3 points of damage for 3 turns.

II<br>Reaction. The acidic blood is moderately strong and deals 4 points of damage for 4 turns.

III<br>Reaction. The acidic blood is strong and deals 5 points of damage for 5 turns.
