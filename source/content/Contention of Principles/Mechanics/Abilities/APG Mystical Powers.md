# Black Bolt
`APG`

Tradition: Fear<br>Material: A shard of volcanic glass

During The Great War, the black bolts of the Dark Lords, ensnaring and burning their targets, were feared by all. In more recent days, other sorcerers have discovered that they can do the same, by extending their tainted souls and using them as a whip that traps and corrodes the enemy. The mystic cannot cast a new black bolt as long as at least one enemy is ensnared by the power, but they are free to make use of other mystical powers.

Novice<br>Active. With a passed \[Resolve←Agility\] test, the character casts a black bolt at an enemy. If successful, the target is hit and suffers 1D6 damage, ignoring Armor. Also, the target is trapped and may not act until it manages to break free, which requires a passed Resolve test (one roll is made each turn after the first) or happens automatically if the mystic loses concentration, \[Resolve –Damage\].

Adept<br>Active. The character casts a chain of black bolts. This works just like at the novice level, but for every target that is hit by the bolt an- other enemy may be attacked, until a failed success test is rolled. All affected enemies may try to break free from the effect of the power, and if one of them succeeds all of them are immediately free to act. The same happens if the mystic loses concentration, \[Resolve –Damage\].

Master<br>Active. The character casts a chain of black bolts, just like at the adept level, but ensnared targets must break free individually; they cannot help each other like at the adept level. If the mystic loses concentration \[Resolve –Damage\] all targets are immediately freed from the entangling darkness.
# Black Breath
`APG`

Tradition: Fear<br>Material: The mystic's own permanent corruption

A mystic with permanent corruption can spew out its inner darkness and infect others with corruption, or heal already tainted creatures.

Novice<br>Active. One (1) creature is hit; roll 1D4 against its total corruption. If the roll is equal to or lower than the corruption value, the creature heals an amount equal to the outcome of the roll; if higher, the creature suffers the outcome in temporary corruption.

Adept<br>Active. Like Novice, but the roll is 1D6.

Master<br>Active. Same as Adept level, but the attack is made in a chain, where another target is hit if the previous one suffered corruption. As soon as someone is healed, the chain is broken.
# Blinding Symbol
`APG`

Tradition: Exaltation<br>Material: A prepared symbol

Intricate runes emit energies that can temporarily blind those who are bedazzled by the light. The effect of a Blinding Symbol is immediately suspended if the victim uses a dose of Eye Drops.

Novice<br>Active. The runes trigger a chain of blinding energies. The target closest to the symbol is blinded if the mystic passes a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test; if this succeeds, an attempt is made to blind the next enemy and so on, until a test fails. The victims are only blinded for one turn before automatically regaining their sight.

Adept<br>Active. Same effect as the novice level. However, the effect lasts until the mystic fails a Resolve test or loses concentration \[Resolve –Damage\].

Master<br>Active. Same effect as the novice level. However, the effect lasts until the afflicted regains Toughness from healing powers or elixirs.
# Buffeting Haven
`Originally Sphere`
`APG`

Tradition: Exaltation<br>Material: Melee weapon

The mystic has their melee weapon spin around at such velocity that it forms a protective haven which effectively parries most attacks. Unfortunately, the mystic cannot perform attacks or use other powers without dispelling the haven. The haven is active until it is willingly aborted, until the mystic uses another power, or until it is dispelled by some other mystic using the power Anathema.

Novice<br>Active. The sphere lets the mystic choose to defend using Resolve instead of Agility. It can protect the mystic from melee and ranged attacks but not from mystical powers. Only movement is allowed while within the sphere – not even actions which normally can replace movement are possible while maintaining the sphere.

Adept<br>Active. The sphere automatically defends against an unlimited number of melee and ranged attacks as long as it is active. However, it does not provide any protection against mystical powers and area effects like explosions, smoke bombs or similar.

Master<br>Active. The master can make a weapon form a sphere without having to touch it. That way, they may include an ally inside the sphere. Also, this leaves the hands of the mystic free for other actions, such as drinking an elixir, bandage an ally's wounds, or unrolling a spell scroll – i.e. such actions that can replace a movement action. The mystic cannot affect the world outside the sphere, but can maintain mystical effects which are already active – the same goes for any ally the mystic protects inside the sphere.
# Combat Hymn
`APG`

Tradition: Captivation<br>Material: None, but the mystic must sing out loud

There is a raw and untamed power in singing, and some mystics learn to sing while fighting to gain considerable extra strength when battling the enemy. The character is one of those who have learned to sing combat hymns to increase their chances in combat. The song is interrupted if the mystic uses another mystical power or if concentration is lost due to taking damage \[Resolve –Damage\].

Novice<br>Free. The character gives himself and all allies a +1 bonus to either Agility, Exactitude, or Might (each ally chooses what attribute will be affected) for as long as the singing continues.

Adept<br>Free. The character gives himself and all allies a +1 bonus to Agility, Exactitude, and Might for as long as the singing continues.

Master<br>Free. The character and all allies gain a +1 bonus to Agility, Exactitude, and Might for as long as the singing continues. Also, the character and all allies regain 1D6 Toughness when the song begins; this healing effect may only be used once per scene.
# Dancing Weapon
`APG`

Tradition: Captivation<br>Material: A melee weapon

By willpower alone, the mystic makes a weapon soar and fight, with the speed and agility of a thought. The weapon in question does not have to be special in any way; if it has qualities or powers, these may be used by the mystic according to standard rules of combat. However, the mystic cannot use other abilities related to melee combat while using this power.

Novice<br>Active. The mystic lets a weapon dance and uses Resolve instead of both Exactitude (attack) and Agility (defense). Other than that, normal combat rules apply. The novice must focus on the weapon while fighting, which prevents them from using other powers or abilities while the weapon dances.

Adept<br>Active. The mystic must take control of the weapon by spending a combat action to activate the power, but then the weapon fights on its own while the mystic is free to use other powers and abilities. Both attack and defense rolls are made against Resolve.

Master<br>Free. The weapon dances out of the scabbard when the master needs it, attacks once per turn and defends the character by itself, leaving the mystic free to use other powers and abilities. Both attack and defense rolls are made against Resolve.
# Derision
`originally Retribution`
`APG`

Tradition: Fear<br>Material: None, only harmful words

Some dark-minded mystics can use their anger and vindictiveness to amass dark energies around a creature they want to hurt. In fact, at the higher levels the effect of this ability becomes instinctive, and all pain that the mystic suffers will undoubtedly be transferred to any enemies in the vicinity.

Novice<br>Active. If the character utters words of doom and passes a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test, misfortune gathers in a dense cloud around an enemy. All who attack the target get a second chance to pass their attack tests during the rest of the scene. Only one enemy at a time can suffer the mystic's Retribution this way; changing the target counts as a combat action.

Adept<br>Reaction. When the character suffers damage and passes a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test, the attacker is bound by a death link. Only one enemy at a time can be bound by a death link, but if a link is broken a new enemy who damages the character can be bound. The death link means that damage suffered by the character is also inflicted upon the bound enemy. This includes all damage, regardless of source. The Pain Threshold is not affected; it is handled separately for the character and the target. Attacks that do not deal damage can be ignored, but in the case of powers that deal damage as part of their effect, any and all damage is transferred through the link. Damage from the monstrous trait Alternative Damage is also transferred to the target. If the character dies (becomes dead or dying) the link is immediately broken and the damage from the attack that felled the character is not transferred.

Master<br>Reaction. Same as at the adept level, but each time the character suffers damage from an attack and passes a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test, the attacker is bound by a death link. Hence, the number of creatures bound is unlimited.
# Draining Glyph
`APG`

Tradition: Fear<br>Material: A carefully crafted glyph

The mystic creates a glyph that upon activation becomes a whirling vortex, sucking the life-force from the enemy. The glyph affects all enemies who can see the symbol and are in front of it.

Novice<br>Active. With a \[Resolve←Might\] test the mystic can damage every enemy in the vicinity (one test per target). The damage is 1D4, ignoring Armor. The effect lasts until the mystic fails a Resolve test or loses concentration \[Resolve –Damage\].

Adept<br>Active. Same as the novice level, but the effect lasts until the mystic fails a Resolve test.

Master<br>Active. The master can direct part of the drained energy into himself or his allies; the stolen life-force heals the mystic or one of their allies, returning 1D4 points of Toughness per turn for as long as effect is active.
# Enervating Throes
`Previously Tormenting Spirits`
`APG`
Only available if `Charisma + Subtlety > 20`<br>Tradition: Fear<br>Material: Quills

The enemy is beset with a harrowing miasma which tears at their clothes, equipment, and flesh. At best, the target cannot act. At worst, they are driven mad or die.

Novice<br>Active. The mystic calls forth transparent needles to attack an enemy. The target automatically fails all tests for concentration while using mystical powers; all other tests have a second chance to fail. The mystic must pass a Resolve test each turn in order for the spirits to continue their attacks.

Adept<br>Active. The mystic attacks ferociously and deals damage to Resolve, adding to the effect described at the novice level. The damage dealt is 1D4 per turn, ignoring armor. If Resolve is reduced to zero, the target dies, presuming they are not allowed to roll death tests (like characters). The latter instead becomes temporarily insane – catatonic, crying or otherwise, unable to act – while rolling their death tests. The Resolve damage heals like other damages. The mystic must pass a Resolve test each turn in order for the spirits to continue their attack. Also, if the mystic takes damage, concentration will be broken if failing a \[Resolve –Damage\] test.

Master<br>Active. Like adept, but the attacks deal 1D6 damage to Resolve.
# Ethereal Shift
`Originally Spirit Walk`
`APG`

 Only available if `Exactitude + Subtlety > 20`<br>Tradition: Captivation<br>Material: A piece of a burial gown

Because of their closeness to death, the mystic has developed the mystical skill to assume the immaterial form of a spirit. Spirit Walk is hindered by Magic Circle, Witch Circle, and Sanctifying Rite; the mystic cannot pass through or leave such areas while moving in the form of a spirit; however, it is possible to assume the spirit form when inside such protected domains. The Spirit Walk also ends if someone lights a Ghost Candle close by (see the alchemical elixir with that name, on page 153 in the Core Rulebook).

Novice<br>Whole Turn. With a passed Resolve test, the mystic assumes spirit form. This immaterial form lasts for one movement action (about 10 meters), making it possible to move through even the thickest walls, or, for that matter, through enemies on the battlefield. All attacks aimed at the mystic are ignored unless they are made with mystical powers or artifacts – both deal only half damage. The movement is all that the character can do during the turn, and after having moved they reassumes their physical form.

Adept<br>Reaction. The spirit form comes instinctively to the mystic. When attacked, the mystic may roll \[Resolve –Damage\] instead of a Defense test; if successful the attack passes through the mystic without dealing damage. The exceptions are mystical powers and artifacts, which deal half damage if the test is passed. The mystic immediately returns to its physical form. The mystic can choose to roll Defense as usual if they prefer, i.e. not use Spirit Walk to avoid a specific attack.

Master<br>Reaction. With a passed Resolve test, the mystic can let an attack – from a weapon or a mystical power dealing damage – start in spirit form and then transcend into physical form once the enemy's armor has been penetrated; if so, the Armor of the target is ignored by the mystic's attack.
# Exorcize
`APG`

Only available if `Resolve + Subtlety > 20`<br>Tradition: Fear<br>Material: A sharp weapon to cut the world's fabric

A fearful mystic's lack of respect for the laws of nature lends them the astounding ability to tear at and bend apparent constants like time and space. One way to make use of this is to temporarily banish creatures from the world of the living, out into the Yonderworld where alien winds howl in chorus with hunting abominations. This poses a danger for the demonologist, since every failed attempt to use the power risks bringing an abomination into the world. If this happens, the abomination attacks a random victim, though not someone who is protected by an Unholy Aura or whose soul is already thoroughly corrupt. The abomination that comes has an equal chance (1d6) of being (1–2) a Vindictive Daemon, 3–4) a Knowledgeable Daemon, or (5–6) a Guardian Daemon (for stats, see the ritual Summon Daemon on page 94).

Novice<br>Active. With a successful \[Resolve←Resolve\] test, the character opens a temporary rift in the world's fabric and sends an enemy through it. The enemy returns one turn later, on the characters initiative and in the same location – steaming from the mists of the Yonderworld and having suffered 1D4 Damage (ignoring Armor) and 1D4 temporary corruption. A failed attempt automatically attracts an abomination that enters through the rift.

Adept<br>Active. With a successful test against \[Resolve←Resolve\], the character sends an enemy further out into the Yonderworld and they must struggle to get back; each turn the enemy may roll a Resolve test, a success brings it back to the world. Every turn spent in the Yonderworld deals 1D4 damage (ignoring Armor) and 1D4 temporary corruption. If the target dies or becomes blight-born, the rift closes and the enemy is gone for good. Since the rift is open for as long as the enemy is expelled, there is a risk that a wrathful abomination slips through – every turn after the first, the mystic must pass a Resolve test to stop an abomination from entering through the rift. If the initial test for using the power fails, the mystic must immediately roll a Resolve test to stop a raging abomination from slipping through into the world. The mystic may choose not to try and stop the abomination from entering, no matter if the abomination comes as an effect of a failed attempt to use the power or as a consequence of a successful long-lasting rift.

Master<br>Reaction. Once per turn, one enemy that attacks the mystic in melee is at risk of being expelled to the Yonderworld, \[Resolve←Resolve\]. If expelled, they suffer the same effect as at the novice level. A failed test has no effect; there is no risk that an abomination enters into the world.
# Fire Soul
`APG`

Only available if `Resolve + Might > 20`<br>Tradition: Exaltation<br>Material: None, but Fire Souls often display physical signs of their attraction to fire; a burning gaze, red hair or heat that radiates from the body

Pyromancers have found that those who dedicate their lives to the study of fire in time learn to instinctively use it as a shield and a weapon. It is even said that the most devoted learn to manipulate the force of hostile fires and paradoxically enough use these burning powers to heal themselves when wounded.

Novice<br>Reaction. When the mystic is hit in melee combat, flames strike out at the attacker, dealing 1D6 damage. Also, the mystic suffers less damage from fire, meaning that they have +1D6 Armor to damage from that element.

Adept<br>Reaction. Like the novice level, except the protection from fire and the damage dealt against those attacking the mystic in melee combat are rolled with 1D10 instead of 1D6.

Master<br>Reaction. The master's power is so great that they do not take damage but is instead healed by fire. The mystic recovers half of any damage that would have been dealt by fire (if the mystic should have suffered 4 damage, they instead heal 2 Toughness). This also pertains to fire created by the mystic when using other powers besides Fire Soul. In addition, the flames that lash out from the mystic when they are attacked now also retaliate at range. Powers that affect the mind will not trigger such a retaliation, but powers which potentially deal damage do. The striking flames deal 1D10 damage and Armor protects as usual.
# Heroic Hymn
`APG`

Tradition: Captivation<br>Material: None, but the mystic must sing out loud

There is power in the heroic hymns of old. The mystic can sing while fighting, thereby filling their allies with courage and vigor. The song is interrupted if the mystic uses another mystical power or if concentration is lost by taking damage \[Resolve –Damage\].

Novice<br>Free. The character gives himself and all allies a +1 bonus to either Charisma, Resolve, or Wit (each ally chooses what attribute will be affected) for as long as the singing continues.

Adept<br>Free. The character gives himself and all allies a +1 bonus to Charisma, Resolve, and Wit for as long as the singing continues.

Master<br>Free. The character and all allies gain a +1 bonus to Charisma, Resolve, and Wit for as long as the singing continues. Also, the temporary corruption of the character and all allies is reduced by 1D4 when the song begins; this corruption reducing effect may only be used once per scene.
# Mirroring
`APG`

Only available if `Subtlety + Wit > 20`<br>Tradition: Captivation<br>Material: A couple of small figurines

Reality's layers of misconceptions and lies may be used to project a series of conceivable phenomena, only one of which corresponds to the reality of the world. The multiple false images created this way serve to protect the mystic from hostile attacks – in most cases; there is always the risk that the enemy targets the mystic instead of an illusion. Every attack against the mystic has a chance of hitting one of the projections or the mystic: if three illusions are made, the chance of the mystic being targeted is 1 out of 4. As the illusions are destroyed, the mystic's risk of being hit increases.

Novice<br>Active. With a passed Resolve test, the mystic projects 1D4 mirror copies of himself. If a copy is hit, it ceases to exist. Damage from area effects hit the mystic as usual and instantaneously dispel all mirror copies.

Adept<br>Active. With a passed Resolve test, the mystic projects 1D6 mirror copies of himself. Damage from area effects hit the mystic as usual and dispel one mirror copy.

Master<br>Active. With a passed Resolve test, the mystic projects 1D8 mirror copies of himself. Damage from area effects hit the mystic as usual but dispel no mirror copies.
# Protective Runes
`APG`

Tradition: Appreciation<br>Material: A depiction of the runes

The mystic's runes emit protective energies that surround the mystic and at higher levels also their allies.

Novice<br>Active. The power of the runes offers +1D4 to Armor until the mystic fails a Resolve test or loses concentration \[Resolve – Damage\]. The extra die of Armor is rolled separately with each hit and is added to any other Armor.

Adept<br>Active. The runes provide +1D4 to Armor (see the novice level). A retaliating effect also inflicts 1D4 damage on every enemy that harms the protected creature, ignoring any Armor. The effect lasts until the mystic fails a Resolve test or loses concentration \[Resolve –Damage\].

Master<br>Active. The protective and retaliating effects are rolled with 1D6 instead of 1D4, and it lasts until the mystic fails a Resolve test.
# Psychic Thrust
`APG`

Only available if `Charisma + Exactitude > 20`<br>Tradition: Fear<br>Material: A shard of glass, sharp as a knife

Some mystics know how to project their will to form a psychic weapon that can attack the enemy together with the mystic's ordinary melee attacks. This means that the enemy must defend on two fronts, and risk failing at both. There is also a chance that the enemy will be paralyzed or severely damaged by the psychic thrust.

Novice<br>Reaction. The mystic performs a normal melee attack in combination with a psychic thrust, aimed at the enemy's defensive capability. The character gains a second chance to succeed on the attack test.

Adept<br>Reaction. The psychic thrust is made in combination with the melee attack, and if the mystic passes a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test the enemy is incapable of defending against the attack. Hence, if this test is successful, the mystic automatically hits the enemy.

Master<br>Reaction. With a successful test against \[Resolve←Resolve\] the enemy is unable to defend and the melee attack hits automatically. Moreover, the enemy suffers 1D4 extra damage, ignoring Armor, in addition to the damage dealt by the melee attack.
# Teleport
`APG`

Only available if `Resolve + Subtlety > 20`<br>Tradition: Fear<br>Material: A sharp weapon to cut the world's fabric

The sorcerers who have gone furthest in questioning the laws of nature can tear holes in the world and step outside, only to tear another rift in the fabric of the Yonderworld and reenter the world of the living in a new location. As always when the shell of reality is perforated, there is a risk that an abomination slips through and attacks a random creature – except those protected by the power Unholy Aura or whose souls are thoroughly corrupt. The abomination that comes has an equal chance (1d6) of being (1–2) a Vindictive Daemon, 3–4) a Knowledgeable Daemon, or (5–6) a Guardian Daemon (for stats, see the ritual Summon Daemon on page 94). How Much do You See of the Yonderworld? The creature who, willingly or not, is thrown into the Yonderworld finds itself in a flowing wasteland. The ground is covered in ashes and even the air is full of whirling soot flakes that feel glowing hot against the skin. If unlucky, the creature lands in the lap of some daemonic abomination; otherwise, such beings can be seen in the distance or heard howling from hunger.

Novice<br>Active. With a passed Resolve test, the character can exit the world and return within a range of two movement actions. The mystic suffers 1D4 damage from the journey through the Yonderworld, ignoring Armor. The teleportation does not trigger a Free Attack, even if withdrawing from melee. The mystic must see the return location when the mystical power is activated. If the test fails an enraged daemon enters through the rift instead.

Adept<br>Active. Same as at the novice level, except the mystic suffers no damage during their trip to the Yonderworld. If the test fails, the mystic must pass a Resolve test to stop an enraged abomination from entering through the rift in the world. The mystic can choose not to stop the entry and willingly let the daemon get through.

Master<br>Active. Same as at the Adept level, with the addition that the mystic may take someone along on the journey. This someone must stand next to the mystic when the power is activated (melee range) and if the creature is reluctant, the mystic must pass a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test to force it to follow. The fellow traveler suffers 1D4 damage, ignoring Armor, and also 1D4 temporary corruption from the traumatic experience. If the test fails, the mystic must pass a Resolve test to stop an enraged abomination from entering through the rift in the world. The mystic can choose not to stop the entry and willingly let the daemon get through.
# Thorn Cloak
`APG`

Only available if `Exactitude + Vigilance > 20`<br>Tradition: Appreciation<br>Material: A thorn bush branch

The plants in nature are usually seen as still and reactive rather than aggressive and active. Experienced green weavers know better and can use surrounding vines, thorns and roots to defend themselves and their allies.

Novice<br>Active. The mystic allows himself to be entwined by vegetation, which provides a bonus of +1D4 in Armor, or +1D6 if the mystic does not move during the whole turn.

Adept<br>Active. Same as at the novice level, but the vegetation branches out to also protect any allies who stand close to the mystic (inside melee range). These allies gain a +1D4 86 bonus to Armor, but this extra protection disappears if they move away from the mystic, or if the mystic moves away from the allies.

Master<br>Active. The mystic and its allies are protected as at the adept level, with the addition that the vegetation strikes back at enemy attackers. Every successful hit in melee against the mystic or a protected ally inflicts 1D10 damage (ignoring Armor) upon the attacker due to lashing thorns.
# Wild Hunt
`APG`

Only available if `Agility + Charisma > 20`<br>Tradition: Appreciation<br>Material: The fur of a beast dead from natural causes

Nature may seem dark and full of conflicts, trapped in an eternal cycle of birth, strife and death. But to mystics who have the capability to see the deeper truth, there is a perfect imbalance to this cycle; a higher form of harmony. This insight can be used by the mystic to acquire the help of seemingly hostile beasts. The summoned beasts may not be of the same type as the enemies; otherwise the type is decided by which types occur naturally in the environment. The mystic dictates how the beasts act during the scene, after which they turn and leave the area.

Novice<br>Active. The mystic can summon one weak beast to aid them in combat.

Adept<br>Active. The mystic calls one ordinary beast or 1D4 weak beasts to aid them in combat.

Master<br>Active. The mystic calls one challenging beast, 1D4 ordinary beasts or 1D6 weak beasts to them in combat.
