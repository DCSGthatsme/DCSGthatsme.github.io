Repeatable

The character knows how to be threatening in an effective way and can scare people into acting according to their will, if only for a short while. They get a +1 bonus to all [[Charisma]] tests pertaining to threats, interrogation, and coercion. The effect is momentary; later the victim will likely backbite the character when a chance presents itself. Horrifying can be acquired multiple times, up to a maximum bonus of +3 on relevant tests.
