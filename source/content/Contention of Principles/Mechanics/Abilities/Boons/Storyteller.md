## Effect
[[Scalable]]

The character is a gifted storyteller and no matter if he narrates legends, religious myths or burlesque tales he will impress the audience. The storyteller gains a +1 bonus on Charisma tests when attempting to weave a credible story to impress listeners, and is skilled enough to earn an income from his performances `(see Income from Boons, page 103)`.
