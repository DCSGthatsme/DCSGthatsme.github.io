## Effect
The character can survive on meager resources and is used to finding food and shelter in harsh terrain. With a successful [[Vigilance]] test, the character can find enough food and water to feed themself while being on the move in the wilderness. If the character is part of a small group (up to five individuals), food and water can be found for them as well, but that will take much more time. The group cannot be on the move during that time.
