## Effect
[[Scalable]]

The character is educated and well-versed in the ways of the world: its cultures, its history. Through extensive studies a character with this boon knows many stories. The Loremaster gets a +1 bonus to tests when researching or when cultural or anthropological knowledge is relevant.
## Notes
* Originally a non-Boon Ability (now called [[Skills]]) from the Symbaroum Core Rulebook.
* This version is changed drastically from what it was originally. It is essentially the Archivist Boon from the Symbaroum Advanced Player's Guide.
