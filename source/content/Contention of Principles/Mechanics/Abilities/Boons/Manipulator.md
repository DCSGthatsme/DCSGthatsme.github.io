## Effect
[[Scalable]]

The character knows how to manipulate others, using flattery, threats, or a combination thereof. They get a +1 bonus to [[Charisma]] versus a specific person during the scene. It takes time to influence someone; it requires a scene of emotional manipulations to achieve the intended effect. On the other hand, the influence lasts longer than when simply lying â€“ the victim accepts the sentiments as their own and will defend them long after the manipulator has left the place.
