The character has established a mystical blood tie to a creature of a different race. Because of this link, they can choose to invest Experience in order to acquire a trait belonging to the race of the blood-friend. It is most likely that the Blood Tie of the character is linked to another Cultural Being, but beasts and other creatures are a possibility. The story of how the character came to enter into the relationship is probably interesting and telling of their life history, maybe also of the character's morals and worldviews.
