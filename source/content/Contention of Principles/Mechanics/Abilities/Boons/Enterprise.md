[[Features|Feature]]

The character owns some kind of establishment â€“ a small tavern, a smaller store or some other simple craft service like a cobbler or trinket shop. Other alternatives are a theater or a troop of acrobats. The enterprise can be stationary in a place often visited by the characters between adventures, or it can be mobile in the form of a wagon or a river boat if that feels more reasonable. Once per adventure (or in-between adventures), the character may roll a Wit (for artisans) or Charisma (for services) test. A success renders a profit of 3d6 x 10 [[Days' Rations]], after all expenses have been paid. If more than one character has Enterprise, it can be parts of the same establishment or business. If so, each character rolls their own profit.
