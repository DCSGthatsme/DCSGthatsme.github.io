## Effect
The character has loose joints and is trained to utilize this in order to get free from bonds or squeeze through narrow passages. They can also get free from the clutches of an enemy or out of traps such as nets and snares. In all these cases, the character gets a second chance to pass the test, no matter which [[Attributes|attribute]] is used.
