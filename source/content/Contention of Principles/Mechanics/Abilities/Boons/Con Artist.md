## Effect
[[Scalable]]

The character is trained to quickly twist the truth, and to generalize or exaggerate when it is called for. The character has a +1 bonus on Charisma and Vigilance tests regarding lies; hence, both for making a lie and noticing when others are lying. The lie's veracity is usually found out quickly, so the liar must hurry if they are to take advantage of it.
