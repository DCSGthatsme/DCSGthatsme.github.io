## Effect
[[Scalable]]

The character is a talented musician and possibly trained in the art of singing and playing an instrument. They can give themself or their group of allies a +1 bonus on all [[Charisma]] tests. A musician's skills can even save their life, as a beautiful voice and the sound of well-tuned strings can calm beasts; if no one threatens the creature, a \[Charisma‚Üê[[Resolve]]\] test will stop it from attacking. The character and their allies may then back away and find another route forward.
