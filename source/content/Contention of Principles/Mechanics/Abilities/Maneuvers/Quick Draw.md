# Ability
Dealing the first blow can decide the outcome of a battle, and with this ability the character has an advantage when an unexpected ambush happens. The character also becomes a much more dynamic warrior, able to quickly switch weapons to meet the demands of any situation.

Novice<br>Free. With a successful test against Agility, the character may unsheathe and draw a weapon as a Free Action, thereby being able to use the weapon as if it was already drawn. The character can also reload a crossbow as a Free Action with a successful Agility Test.

Adept<br>Free. With a successful Agility test, the character may switch weapons as a Free Action, meaning that the character can sheathe one weapon and draw another in one fluid motion.

Master<br>Free. The character handles elixirs swiftly and may with a successful Agility test pour one dose down their own or a nearby ally's throat as a Free Action.
