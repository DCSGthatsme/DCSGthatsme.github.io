# Ability
Feared barbarian warriors have developed the practice of working themselves into a berserker frenzy before battle. By letting the repressed anger of the heart strengthen their limbs, the character can unleash a fuming rage that, if channeled correctly, might sway the tide of battle.

Novice<br>Free. As a Free Action, the character may enter into a murderous frenzy to solely focus on hurting the enemy, dealing 1D6 extra damage when fighting in melee combat. The downside of this frenzy is that the character cannot defend themself properly. The attribute on which Defense is based, is considered to be 5 when calculating Defense. `Exit rage as free action? any conditions?`

Adept<br>Reaction. The rage is like armor to the character. They ignore 1D4 damage from each hit suffered while in a berserker rage.

Master<br>Free. The character has managed to harness their rage without losing any of their power. The character can utilize this capacity to both deal and ignore extra damage, while still being able to defend themself as normal.
