# Ability
The character is trained to wrestle, both with and without the protection of armor.

The trait Robust adds a bonus to Might when throwing an opponent or resisting being thrown: +2 at novice level, +4 at adept level, +8 at master level. Robust gives no bonus if some other attribute besides Might is used.`?`

Novice<br>Active. The character knows the basic wrestling maneuvers and can use them against armed opponents. Also, the character can wrestle while holding weapons; they need not be dropped or put away. The attack is made as usual and if successful the wrestler gets the enemy in a firm grip. The wrestler may then try to throw the enemy or just maintain the grip; both alternatives require a \[Might竊信ight\] test. The throw inflicts 1D4 damage, ignoring armor, and leaves the enemy flat on their back. The alternative to a throw, maintaining the grip, inflicts no damage, but the enemy cannot act until the wrestler fails a \[Might竊信ight\] test. Also, all allies of the wrestler have Advantage on the gripped enemy. The wrestler is unable to do anything else while maintaining the grip, leaving them vulnerable: all enemies have Advantage on the wrestler.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character has learned how to counter an opponent's strength and can use it to throw the enemy to the ground. First, the wrestler must pass a normal Defense test verses the enemy's melee attack, then they must pass a \[Agility竊信ight\] test. The throw deals 1D4 damage, ignoring armor, and the thrown enemy ends up flat on their back, loses their breath and is unable to perform any active actions during the following turn.

Master<br>Reaction. The reactive throw of the character (see the adept level) only requires a passed \[Agility竊信ight\] test, no Defense test is needed. If the throw fails, then a Defense test is rolled to avoid being hit. The master's throw deals 1D6 damage, ignoring armor, and the thrown enemy ends up flat on their back, loses their breath and is unable to perform any active actions during the following turn. Furthermore, the master wrestler immediately gets a Free Attack on the enemy.
