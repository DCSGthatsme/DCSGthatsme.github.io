# Ability
Whatever the material armors the character, the Man-at-arms ability gives them increased protection against hostile strikes and blows.

Novice<br>Passive. The character knows how to use their armor for maximum effect, which increases the armor's Armor tier by one: light armor protects 1D6, medium armor protects 1D8 and heavy armor protects 1D10.

Adept<br>Passive. The character is used to wearing armor and can adapt their actions to its limitations. The armor no longer has a negative effect on [[Agility]] or abilities based on Agility (including Defense). The Impeding quality of the armor still has a negative effect when using mystical powers.

Master<br>Reaction. The character may roll against Agility to counteract effects from Abilities or equipment that make enemy attacks ignore or reduce their Armor value; if the test is successful the Armor protects as usual. [[Mystical powers]] that ignore Armor may not be blocked this way; they are not affected by the Man-at-arms ability.
