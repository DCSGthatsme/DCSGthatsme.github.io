# Ability
The character has realized that the creatures of the wild are best combated after having been caught and fettered.

Trained trappers can deploy and disarm both mechanical traps and alchemical mines. Furthermore, when the need arises, the character can quickly manufacture improvised traps from materials at hand. See more on the rules regarding traps on 102APG.

Novice<br>Active. With a passed [[Wit]] test, the character can use a Primary Action to deploy or disarm a mechanical trap. The effect depends on the level of the trap (see page 127APG). The character can also build an improvised trap, but this requires an whole entire round to complete. An improvised trap made by the character deals 1D6 damage.

Adept<br>Active. The character can handle alchemical mines the same way they handle mechanical traps. An improvised trap made by the character now deals 1D8 damage.

Master<br>Active. The character is a renowned trapper who knows how to utilize any kind of trap. Traps and mines are counted as one tier higher: weak becomes moderate, moderate becomes strong, and strong devices allow the character a second chance on success tests. The enemies' attempts to discover, disarm, or get free become more difficult; the damage dice are rolled twice and the higher outcome stands. For alchemical traps, the damage reroll only pertains to the initial explosion, not the ongoing damage that follows. Improvised traps now deal 1D10 damage.
