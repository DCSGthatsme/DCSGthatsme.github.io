## Ability
Active<br>You attack from an [[Advantage]], aiming to render the target unconscious. The attack is made as usual, but instead of dealing damage, roll 1D12: if the damage value is greater than the d12, the target is knocked out. If the attack fails, you lose the Advantage over the target.
