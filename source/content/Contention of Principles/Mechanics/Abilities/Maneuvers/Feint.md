# Ability
Persons and creatures that lack the will or strength to wield heavy melee weapons instead develop techniques for feinting. This ability demands a weapon with either the Short or the Precise quality. Thanks to the skill of the character, these weapons can be handled in a both discreet and confusing manner.

Novice<br>Passive. The character can choose to attack with Subtlety instead of Exactitude when the attack is made with a melee weapon which is either Short or Precise. Also, every such attack gains the same Advantage as if the opponent was surprised.

Adept<br>Reaction. The character presents a false weakness in their defense and tricks the opponent into attacking that weakness. The character can choose to defend themself with Subtlety instead of Agility.

Master<br>Active. With a successful \[Subtlety‚ÜêVigilance\] roll the character can surprise an enemy in the middle of an ongoing fight. A successful test gives the character a Free Attack against that enemy in addition to their ordinary attack. The character may still perform an ordinary attack even if the attempted Feint fails.
