# Ability
Weapons are not always available or practical. Through long and hard training, the character has become a dangerous opponent even when unarmed.

Novice<br>Passive. The character has learned to use their natural-born warrior capabilities with great efficiency. The character's unarmed attacks now deal 1D6 damage. If they also have the Natural Weapons monstrous trait, then the damage is further increased according to the level of Natural Weapons.

Adept<br>Active. With the speed of an adept, the character may now perform a double unarmed attack against a single target. The two attacks are rolled separately.

Master<br>Passive. By attacking an opponent's weak points with flawless precision – such as throat and knees – the master's unarmed strikes are truly devastating. Each attack that hits deals 1D6 extra damage.
