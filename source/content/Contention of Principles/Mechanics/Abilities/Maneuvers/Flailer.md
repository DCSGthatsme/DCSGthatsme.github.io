# Ability
The character has studied the secrets of the jointed weapons and learned to make full use of their potential.

Novice<br>Passive. In the character's hands, a jointed weapon gains the quality Ensnaring, and may therefore be used to ensnare an enemy, instead of making a normal attack.

Adept<br>Passive. The character can put great force into the secondary damage of jointed weapons; such hits now deal 1D8 damage, instead of 1D6.

Master<br>Active. The master flailer can use a jointed weapon to continue to strike even after having hit a target. The character may perform attacks against all enemies within range of melee; each attack is rolled separately.
