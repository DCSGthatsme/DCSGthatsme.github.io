## Ability
The creature has multiple heads or limbs governed by separate minds, and can use them independently of each other. Damage is suffered separately by each part, as if they were separate creatures, so they have to be taken out one by one. Only once all are eliminated does the creature die. A drawback is that the features Armored and Robust are weakened at the higher levels of Many-headed: such a massive and simultaneously limber body cannot fully utilize all its protection and strength in all directions at once.

I<br>Passive. The creature has two limbs or heads and may act with them separately; the creature has two combat actions per turn.

II<br>Passive. The creature has four limbs or heads and may act with them separately; the creature has four combat actions per turn. The features Armored and Robust count as one level lower for the creature.

III<br>Passive. The creature has eight limbs or heads and may act with them separately; the creature has eight combat actions per turn. The features Armored and Robust count as two levels lower for the creature.
