## Ability
When the creature dies, its accumulated wrath is unleashed in attacks against those unlucky enough to be within reach.

I
Reaction. The creature's death struggle lets it perform a free attack against an enemy within melee range, as a reaction to the attack that killed it.

II<br>Reaction. As I, but the attack is any normal combat action.

III<br>Reaction. As II, but the creature may attack up to five enemies that it can reach without moving.
