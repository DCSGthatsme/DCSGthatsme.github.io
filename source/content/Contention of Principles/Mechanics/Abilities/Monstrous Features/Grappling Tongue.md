## Ability
The creature has a long tongue which can be used to attack and grapple targets which are within [[Distance|medium range]]. The attack counts and deals damage as a bite, and if the target has at least one level lower than the creature in the feature Robust, the creature may try to pull the target into melee range. The target rolls a \[Might←Might\] test; if it fails, the target is pulled towards the creature which then can combine Grappling Tongue with other features, such as Devour and Crushing Embrace.
