## Ability
The creature has a supernatural sense which lets it perceive living beings. This makes the creature difficult to surprise, and at higher levels it can also be used actively to surprise others.

I<br>Passive. The creature picks up on tiny vibrations in the ground and air, and can perceive creatures from behind robust walls and closed doors, or through meter thick layers of soil. Anyone trying to avoid being detected must pass a test against \[Subtlety←Vigilance\].

II<br>Passive. As I, but the perception is so precise that the creature can attack those it detects through the barrier. If the wall, door, layer of soil or similar is thick, the creature has to have a monstrous feature which lets it pass through the barrier, such as Spirit Form, Wrecker, or Tunneler.

III<br>Passive. At this level, the creature with the Life Sense can even use mystical powers against detected enemies in the vicinity, as if they were in its line of sight.
