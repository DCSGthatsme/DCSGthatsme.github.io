## Ability
The creature exudes harmful energies that each turn deal damage to everyone within melee range. Also, the creature leaves clear marks in its wake, in the form of a burnt, frozen, or otherwise warped trail through the environment. Hence, all attempts to track the creature automatically succeed. The aura can consist of fire, cold, acid, or lightning. Together with the feature Alternative Damage, the aura affects the chosen Attribute instead of Health, but only if the creature has Alternative Damage to at least the same level as Effluence. The aura can also be corrupting or poisonous instead, if the creature has the features Corrupting Attack or Poisonous to the same level or higher.

I<br>Passive. All who are within melee range of the creature suffer 2 points of damage each turn, ignoring Toughness.

II<br>Passive. As I, but the damage is 3 per turn.

III<br>Passive. As I, but the damage is 4 per turn.
