The creature's attack harms a specific [[Attributes|Attribute]] instead of [[Health]], usually [[Might]] or [[Resolve]]. If not specified in the monster description, the Game Master decides which one. This kind of damage affects all rolls made using that Attribute.

Alternative Damage heals, and can be healed, just like ordinary damage. If the Attribute reaches 0, the victim's life force is devoured by the attacker and the victim dies. Alternative Damage requires the [[Spirit Form]] [[Monstrous Features|Monstrous Feature]].

II<br>Passive. The creature's natural weapon deals 4 alternative damage, ignoring Toughness.
