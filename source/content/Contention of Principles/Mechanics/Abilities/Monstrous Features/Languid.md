I<br>Passive. The creature is not affected by poison or diseases, but takes the usual damage from physical effects except that the [[Pain Tolerance]] is not used. The walking corpse does not heal naturally and is not affected by healing Alchemical Substances, but must instead eat raw meat (living or recently killed) or drink blood to heal, each point of [[Health]] that the creature consumes heals it by 2 points of Health.

II<br>Passive. The walking corpse suffers only half damage from ordinary physical effects, such as weapons or elemental damage. Mystical powers that ignore [[Toughness]] deal full damage as usual.

III<br>Passive. The walking corpse suffers only half damage from alchemical and mystical effects as well, but takes full damage from magical weapons and holy effects.
