## Ability
The creature thirsts for warm blood, and with its gaze it can put its victim into a trance before feasting on its life-giving juices.

I<br>Active. The creature may charm \[[[Resolve]]←Resolve\] and bite its victim in a single Primary Action. The bloodsucker then slurps blood, dealing 2 damage per turn, ignoring Toughness. It takes a \[Resolve←Resolve\] each turn to maintain the trance. Damaging the bloodsucking creature can also break the trance, \[Resolve –Damage\].

II<br>Active. As I, but the bloodsucking creature also heals as much [[Health]] as it draws from the victim.

III<br>Active. As II, but damage and healing is 3 per turn. Also, the victim itself cannot break the trance; someone else has to attack and damage the bloodsucker for the control to be lost, \[Resolve –Damage\].
