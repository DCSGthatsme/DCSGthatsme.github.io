## Ability
The creature has no fixed shape, adapting its form to its surroundings and the challenges it faces. The effect lasts until the creature opts to switch features or it is targeted by the mystical power True Form â€“ if successful, this removes the features provided by the Metamorphosis, until a new active action is spent on getting them back. Through the process of adapting itself, the creature can take on a form giving it characteristics that correspond to one or more of the following features: Acidic Attack, Amphibian, Armored, Carapace, Deadly Breath, Diminutive, Grappling Tongue, Natural Weapon, Poisonous, Poison Spit, Prehensile Claws, Robust, Tunneler, Web, Wings.

I<br>Active. The creature can adopt one of the listed features, corresponding to level I.

II<br>Active. The creature can adopt two of the listed features corresponding to level I, or one corresponding to level II.

III<br>Active. The creature can adopt two of the listed features corresponding to level II, or one corresponding to level III.
