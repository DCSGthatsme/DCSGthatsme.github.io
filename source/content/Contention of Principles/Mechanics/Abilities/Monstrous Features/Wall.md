## Ability
The creature can produce walls or other impediments. At higher levels, the wall can also deal damage to those trying to pass it, or even grip and hold them.

I<br>Active. The creature raises a wall wide enough to require two movement actions to get around it. The wall could also be used to block a cave or similar opening. The wall can be destroyed, according to the rules on Damage on Buildings. The wall has Health 10, Breakpoint 5, and Fortification value 5. The wall remains for an entire scene, unless it is destroyed or the creature opts to spend a new active action to move it. If destroyed, a new wall cannot be raised until the next day.

II<br>Active. As I, but enemies that come close to the wall must pass a \[Agility←Exactitude\] test or be attacked by the wall, dealing 3 damage (ignoring Toughness). The only way to avoid this is to spend another movement action when rounding the wall, a total of three, and hence bypass the wall at a safe distance.

III<br>Free. As II, but the wall deals 5 damage. If it hits and if the target fails a \[Might←Might\] test, the target is also gripped until it passes a \[Might←Might\] test, or the wall is destroyed or moved. A gripped target is not attacked by the wall again until the moment when it succeeds in getting free.
