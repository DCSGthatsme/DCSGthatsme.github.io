## Ability
The creature can use its body mass to crush, or at least push away, enemies in its path. The feature does not protect against Free Attacks caused by Long weapons or movements past prepared enemies. Rampage requires at least the corresponding level of the Robust feature.

I<br>Movement Action. Everyone standing in the creature's path during the movement must pass a \[Might←Might\] test or take 2 damage (Toughness protects as usual) and be knocked down. The Robust feature adds +2 damage per level (+2, +4, +6), and the same bonus to Might, both when using and trying to defend against Rampage. As soon as a victim passes its test, the crushing rampage stops. Enemies with the Acrobatics ability can choose to defend with \[Agility←Might\] and thereby dodge, but if so, a successful test will not stop the Rampage.

II<br>Movement Action. As I, but deals 3 damage.

III<br>Movement Action. As I, but deals 4 damage.
