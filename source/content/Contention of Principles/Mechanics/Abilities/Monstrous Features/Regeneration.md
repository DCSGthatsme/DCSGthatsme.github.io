The creature spontaneously heals, without needing to spend either time or power to do so. However, the creature has a weakness, a specific type of damage that it cannot regenerate (which, of course, can be healed in other active ways). The creature must choose a weakness related to some kind of damage it cannot heal automatically. Choose between magical weapons, elemental energies (fire or acid) and damage from either holy or unholy attacks.
