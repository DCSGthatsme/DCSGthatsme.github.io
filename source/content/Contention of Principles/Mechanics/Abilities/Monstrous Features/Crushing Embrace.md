## Ability
The creature's [[Natural Weapon]] allows it to grip, hold on to and crush its enemies.

I<br>Reaction. When the creature deals damage with its natural weapon, it may try to take hold of the enemy. To avoid being caught, the target must successfully roll a \[[[Agility]]←[[Exactitude]]\] test. If the target fails it must succeed with a \[[[Might]]←Might\] test to get loose, or suffer 2 damage each turn as the grip tightens (ignoring [[Toughness]]). A gripped target may not act, but the creature also loses one Primary Action per turn and gripped victim.

II<br>Reaction. As I, but the damage is 3 per turn.

III<br>Reaction. As I, but the damage is 4 per turn.
