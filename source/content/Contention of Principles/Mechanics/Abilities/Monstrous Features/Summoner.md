## Ability
The creature can summon reinforcements which disappear upon the summoner's death or at the end of the scene. The reinforcements obey the orders of the summoner, but have to hear them being spoken or shouted – they are not controlled telepathically.

I<br>Active. Once per scene, the creature can make a successful test against Resolve to summon a daemonic Intruder.

II<br>Reaction. As I, but additionally, once per turn when the creature is hit by a hostile attack, it may make a test against Resolve – if successful, a daemonic Intruder is immediately summoned to the location.

III<br>Free. Once per turn, the creature can roll a test against Resolve to summon a daemonic Intruder to the location. If successful, this replaces the reactive summoning of the adept level and the active summoning of the novice level. Should the free summoning of the master level fail, the creature can opt to activate the novice level effect, though only once per scene.
