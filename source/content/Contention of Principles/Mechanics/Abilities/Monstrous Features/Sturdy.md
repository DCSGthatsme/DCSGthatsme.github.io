## Ability
The monster possesses a remarkable vitality, possibly born out of a strong link to the forces of nature, or maybe stemming from a bottomless source of corruption. The creature's Health is higher than its Might value would suggest, but its Pain Threshold is unaffected (based on Might/2, as usual).

I<br>Passive. The creature's Health is based on its Might × 1.5 (rounded up).

II<br>Passive. The creature's Health is based on its Might × 2.

III<br>Passive. The creature's Health is based on its Might × 3.
