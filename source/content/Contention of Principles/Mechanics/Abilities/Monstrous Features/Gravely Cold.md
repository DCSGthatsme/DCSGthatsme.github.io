Wherever it moves, the creature spreads the cold of the grave around itself like an aura, and everyone in its immediate vicinity is at risk of being affected.

I<br>Free. The creature spreads the paralyzing cold of the grave; enemies within melee distance are paralyzed, should they fail a Resolve test. One test is made each turn, and should the test be successful, the enemy can act as normal. Once an enemy has withstood the cold of the grave it cannot be affected again during the same scene.

II<br>Free. As I, but with the addition that the cold is harmful, dealing 2 points of damage per turn to those affected, ignoring [[Toughness]].

III<br>Free. As II, but the cold now affects enemies who fail a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test.
