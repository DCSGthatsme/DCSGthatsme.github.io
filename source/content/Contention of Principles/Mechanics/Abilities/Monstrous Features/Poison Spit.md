The creature is not just Poisonous; it can also spit venom at its enemies. The poison attack is performed just like an ordinary ranged attack; if hit the victim must pass a \[[[Might]]‚Üê[[Wit]]] test to avoid being poisoned. The venomous spit counts as a ranged attack. The poison's effect can be cancelled if someone applies an antidote and succeeds with a Wit test. Poison Spit requires that the creature has the [[Poisonous]] [[Monstrous Features|Monstrous Feature]] at the same level or higher.
