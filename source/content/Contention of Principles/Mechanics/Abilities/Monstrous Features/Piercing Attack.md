## Ability
The attack deals no normal damage. Instead, the damage value determines whether the attack manages to surpass the victim's Toughness. If the Toughness is equal to or higher than the damage value, the attack fails; if the Toughness is lower, the victim suffers an effect such as poison or corruption, depending on what other features the creature has.

I<br>Passive. The attack has a damage value of 4.

II<br>Passive. The attack has a damage value of 5.

III<br>Passive. The attack has a damage value of 6.
