## Ability
The collective gains mystical powers when enough members are gathered closely together; the more members, the mightier their collective power, up to a certain limit.

| Collective Size | # of Powers | Power Level |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1-3             | 0           | -           |
| 4-6             | 1           | Novice      |
| 7-10            | 1           | Adept       |
| 11-20           | 2           | Adept       |
| 21+             | 2           | Master      |
[[Subjugate]] or [[Curse]] are recommended as powers.

The collective can perform one mystical power per turn, in addition to the actions of its individual members. This action is activated on the turn of the individual of the collective with the highest acting precedence. The power works as usual, but its collective origin makes it harder for the enemy to break the concentration of the caster â€“ three of the collective have to lose concentration during the same turn for it to have an effect on the ongoing power.
