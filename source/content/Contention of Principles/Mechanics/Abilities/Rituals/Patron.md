## Ability
Crux: [[Exaltation]]

The mystic is accompanied by a guardian which manifests as a warrior of light that normally is invisible but starts to shine when danger is close, and protects their ward until their second death. Only one Patron can be bound to a mystic at a time, and should they be defeated a new one must be summoned.

A Patron is handled by the player as if it was an additional character. It gains [[Experience]] as a player character, but loses it if it dies (no death tests allowed).

A Patron has the trait Spirit Form (I), and starts with the following statistics: Exactitude 13, Charisma 5, Wit 7, Subtlety 9, Agility 15, Resolve 10, Might 11, Vigilance 10 Weapons Flail of light 1D6 Defense 15 (Dodge) Armor Half damage (see Spirit Form I) Toughness 11 Pain Threshold 6

Patrons cannot be equipped with weapons and armor. However, if the saint uses their experience to gain an Ability related to some kind of weapon, the Light Flail transforms accordingly.

Whenever a patron gains an Ability, its ward takes 1D4 Temporary [[Corruption]].
