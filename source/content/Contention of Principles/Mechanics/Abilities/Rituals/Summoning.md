## Ability
Crux: [[Appreciation]]

The mystic summons a creature by making a successful Resolve test. The creature must then make its way to the location of the summoning. The mystic must have something in their possession related to the summoned creature, either an object of great value to the creature, or an actual part of it, such as a drop of blood or a lock of hair. The summoned creature will try to reach the location to the best of its abilities but does not necessarily know why it wants to go there, other than following an irresistible calling. The only way to protect a creature that has been summoned is to trick and lure it to step inside a mystically shielded area (the [[Predilection]], [[Blotch Circle]] or [[Sanctum]] rituals) or use the [[Break Link]] ritual.
