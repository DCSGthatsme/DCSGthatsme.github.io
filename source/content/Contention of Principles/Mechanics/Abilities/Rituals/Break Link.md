## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]

The mystic can break any current mystical links and bonds to an object or a person by trapping the target in a circle of mystical runes and making a successful [[Resolve]] test. The magic of the object is not affected but the target can no longer be reached with rituals like [[Hound]] and [[Summoning]]. In addition, any mystical bonds that may have been created by people visiting the location are negated, which can be used to prevent others from using [[Clairvoyance]] and [[Seven-journey Stride]] to view or reach the location until they have visited the location again. Finally, Break Link can be used to cut the bond between a creature and an [[Artifacts|artifact]].
