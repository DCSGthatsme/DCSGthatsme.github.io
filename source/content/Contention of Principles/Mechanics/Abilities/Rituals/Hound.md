## Ability
Crux: [[Exaltation]]

With a successful [[Resolve]] test, the mystic can track a creature that the mystic has met personally. The tracking is impeccable until the creature crosses water â€“ if it does, the ritual must be performed again on the far side of the stream. Should the test fail, the mystic cannot try again until the next day.
