## Ability
Crux: [[Fear]]

The mystic desecrates a specific site, tainting it and in effect punishing those who try to affect it from outside. A desecrated location corrupts those who use rituals like [[Clairvoyance]], [[Summoning]], or [[Hound]] on it. The desecration gives 1D6 temporary [[Corruption]] to those who perform said rituals and if they persist in trying to get information with rituals they will also suffer 1D6 permanent Corruption. Corrupted creatures are drawn to desecrated areas and heal 1D4 points of [[Health]] for each hour they remain on desecrated ground. Even creatures that are only tainted by Corruption, but are not Fully Corrupted, feel a strong attraction to desecrated areas and objects.
