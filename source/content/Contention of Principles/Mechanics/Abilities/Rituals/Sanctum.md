This [[Rituals|Ritual]] can be acquired via the [[Ritualist]] Ability.
## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]

The mystic can use this ritual to cover a location (one large or a couple of smaller rooms) in a magical shroud, making it impossible to peek inside or disturb it from outside with mystical powers. Sanctum blocks the effect of rituals like [[Clairvoyance]], [[Summoning]], or [[Hound]], but should any of these rituals be tracking or hunting a person the block is gone as soon as the person leaves the Sanctum. If there is a [[Magic Circle]] within an area affected by Sanctum (regardless of which was there first), then no one but the mystic who performed the Sanctum can use the circle for communication or for the purpose of performing a [[Seven-journey Stride]].
