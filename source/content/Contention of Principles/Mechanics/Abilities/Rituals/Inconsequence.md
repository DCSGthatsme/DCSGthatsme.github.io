## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]

By making a successful [[Resolve]] test, the mystic can target themself or an ally. The mystic chooses one of the five primary senses. The target does not affect that sense in others.

Note that choosing sight does not make the target transparent; they will appear to others as a black smudge.

Note that choosing touch does not make the target incorporeal; they will still affect the physicality of things. The target will simply not trigger a sense of physical contact within others. This does not prevent the target from inflicting the sense of pain.
