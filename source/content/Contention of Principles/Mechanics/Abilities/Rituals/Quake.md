## Ability
Only available if [[Might]] + [[Vigilance]] ≥ 23<br>Crux: [[Exaltation]]

The mystic draws on the wrath of the bedrock stores it within a weapon. When needed, the mystic can slam a blunt end of the weapon into a surface, spending the stored energy to unleash the force of the earth like waves on water.

No matter if the Quake is directed into the ground or towards an object, the mage suffers 1D6 temporary [[Corruption]] upon activation
* Into the ground: The mage strikes the ground and sets off shock waves that topple all creatures nearby with a passed \[[[Resolve]]←[[Agility]]\] test – one roll per creature, ally, or enemy. The mystic and adjacent allies are excluded from the effect, just like any enemies within melee range. Those who fall suffer 1D4 damage, ignoring [[Toughness]].
* Towards an object: The Quake is powerful enough to crush bridges, walls and doors. The damage dealt is rolled as a usual hit with the weapon, but with one lower tier of damage die and the [[Wrecking]] quality thanks to the ritual; the staff damages structures as if it is a battering ram. See the rule Damage on Buildings, page 106APG, for more information.

Doors turn to splinters while floors and bridges crumble to dust. If the mystic crushes a floor, they remain standing on the edge of the rupture, but before them a hole big enough to require two movement actions to get around opens up. Naturally, if it instead is a bridge that is crushed, anyone wanting to pass must climb or swim to the other side.
