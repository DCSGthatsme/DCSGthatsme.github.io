## Ability
Crux: [[Appreciation]]

The mystic can ask a dead person a number of questions, either by sitting next to their body (just a skull will do, as well) or their grave. Each question demands a successful [[Resolve]] test, and the dead answers either ‘yes' or ‘no' by knocking: one knock for ‘no' and two for ‘yes'. In the case of a failure the mystic can still try to force an answer from the dead, but at the risk of becoming possessed by the spirit; roll \[Resolve←Resolve\]. If the test is failed the mystic becomes possessed and is forced to perform the last wish of the dead, often of a vengeful nature.
