## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]

The mystic binds a mystical power to a certain location or to an object. All Spell Traps need to be given a trigger criterion when created. Such a criterion can, for instance, be that a living creature enters the room, that someone steps on the Spell Trap or that a weapon is drawn in the vicinity. The mystic can exclude themself from being able to trigger the trap, but their allies cannot be excluded â€“ if they meet the criterion, the power is activated. The mystic who makes the Spell Trap does not have to know the power which is to be trapped, but in that case they need the assistance of a mystic who does. The Spell Trap can be dispelled with [[Anathema]] or the ritual [[Break Link]].
