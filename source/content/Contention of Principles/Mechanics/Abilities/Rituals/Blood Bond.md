## Ability
Crux: [[Appreciation]]

The corrupting effect of magic is of course well known to mystics. Sometimes the [[Corruption]] is a necessary price to pay in order to succeed with whatever task the mystic has undertaken. In the same way, the tainting of a familiar can be a necessary sacrifice for the mystic to be able to continue serving their people or their calling. By using this bond of blood, the mystic can share Corruption with their familiar. The mystic has to make a [[Resolve]] test whenever a Blood Bond ritual is attempted. A successfully performed ritual decreases the mystic's permanent Corruption by 1D4 points, and increases the familiars permanent Corruption by 1D6. The familiar suffers all the usual signs of Corruption. Should the familiar become corrupted, the mystic loses control and is immediately attacked by their former companion. The ritual costs one (1) [[Experience]] to perform, whether it is successful or not. The mystic cannot perform the ritual for someone else.
