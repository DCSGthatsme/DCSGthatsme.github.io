## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]

The mystic can restore a damaged item â€“ a broken sword is mended, a shattered vase is reassembled, and a corroded lock regains its functionality. The restored item recovers all its functions and qualities.

Alternatively, the mystic can duplicate an item. The duplicate is created from the supplied materials. All materials used to make the original must be present in equal or greater quantity than was used to make the original.

In either application, the creation will only succeed if the details of the item's creation are understood and envisioned by the mystic. Additionally, the creation will fail if a catalyzing process would be required. If the creation is successful, it will be indistinguishable from the original.
