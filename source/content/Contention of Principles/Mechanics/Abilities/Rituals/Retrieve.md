## Ability
Crux: [[Appreciation]]

The mystic can reveal the path to a lost or displaced object. This requires that the mystic, or someone who is in their company, knows the object so well that they can describe it in detail. If the object in question has been purposefully hidden, the mystic must pass a \[[[Resolve]]‚Üê[[Subtlety]]\] test to learn its whereabouts.
