## Ability
Crux: [[Exaltation]]

A successful roll against [[Resolve]] allows the mystic to ask an open question about the future of the ongoing adventure. This ritual can only be used once per adventure, regardless of what happens. The Game Master's answer must be truthful, but not necessary easily interpreted or too revealing.
