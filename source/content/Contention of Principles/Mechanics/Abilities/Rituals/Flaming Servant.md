## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]

The mystic awakens a fierce fire creature and binds it to a suit of metal (medium or heavy armor). The servant then walks by the mystic's side like a smoldering and steaming bodyguard, which flares up and turns into a burning warrior in battle. The mystic can only have one Flaming Servant bound to themself at any time, and if the Flaming Servant perishes in battle, then the suit of armor needs to be repaired by a blacksmith in order for the ritual to be placed on that same armor again. The Flaming Servant is handled by the player as if it was an additional character. It gains [[Experience]] as a player character, but loses it if it dies (no death tests allowed).

A Flaming Servant starts with the following statistics: Exactitude 13, Charisma 5, Wit 7, Subtlety 9, Agility 11, Resolve 10, Might 15, Vigilance 10 Weapons Burning sword 1D8 Defense 9 (Shield) Armor Smoldering scale mail 1D6 (Impedance) Health 15 Pain Tolerance 8
