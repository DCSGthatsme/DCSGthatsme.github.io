## Ability
Crux: [[Appreciation]]

The mystic binds themself to a beast. This beast is not much smarter than others of its kind, but is fiercely loyal to the mystic and the bond between them is made up of mystical energies â€“ they are soulmates. The spiritual bond is so strong that the two can communicate telepathically; the mystic can command the familiar from a distance and also experience whatever the familiar perceives with its senses. The depth of this union also makes it possible for the two to share wounds. If the familiar is wounded the mystic can choose to suffer half of the damage, or if the mystic is wounded half of the damage can be transferred to the familiar. The player decides when damage should be shared in this way. There is also a downside to the mystical bond: should the familiar die the mystic suffers 1D8 points of damage, ignoring [[Protection]]. The familiar is managed by the player as if it was an additional character. It gains [[Experience]] as a player character, but loses it if it dies (no death tests allowed).
