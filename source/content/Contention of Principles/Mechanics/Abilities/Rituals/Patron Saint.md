## Ability
Crux: [[Exaltation]]

The mystic is accompanied by a guardian spirit, the soul of a fallen Templar given the mission to once again serve one of the Sun God's chosen. The martyr manifests as a warrior of light that normally is invisible but starts to shine when danger is close, and protects their ward until their second death. Only one Patron Saint can be bound to a mystic at a time, and should the saint be defeated a new one must be summoned.

A Patron Saint is handled by the player as if it was an additional character. It gains [[Experience]] as a player character, but loses it if it dies (no death tests allowed).

A Patron Saint has the trait Spirit Form (I), and starts with the following statistics: Exactitude 13, Charisma 5, Wit 7, Subtlety 9, Agility 15, Resolve 10, Might 11, Vigilance 10 Weapons Flail of light 1D6 Defense 15 (Dodge) Armor Half damage (see Spirit Form I) Toughness 11 Pain Threshold 6

Patron Saints cannot be equipped with other weapons and armor from the start. If the saint uses their experience to gain an Ability related to some kind of weapon the Light Flail transforms accordingly.
