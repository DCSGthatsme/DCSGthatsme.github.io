## Ability
Crux: [[Appreciation]]

The mystic alters the local weather as they see fit. Fog that obscures one's view, storms that prevent trips or the calming of such storms are all possible to achieve. The ritual takes one hour to perform and the effect remains active for half a day; after that the local weather returns to its natural form.
