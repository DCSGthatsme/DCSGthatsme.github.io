## Ability
Crux: [[Fear]]

With a passed [[Resolve]] test, the mystic can inflict pain on an enemy from a distance, by damaging a doll or driving nails into a trace left by the target. The ritual also requires a mystical link to the victim â€“ some hair strands, a puddle of blood or an item that the target holds dear. The victim does not suffer any damage but experiences acute pains and cannot heal by any means during the days of torment. It takes the tormentor one hour to perform the ritual, but no success test is needed after the first. Black Sympathy can be aborted with the ritual [[Break Link]]. After that, the Black Sympathy cannot be resumed using the same mystical link, nor before thirty days have passed, even if a new link is available.
