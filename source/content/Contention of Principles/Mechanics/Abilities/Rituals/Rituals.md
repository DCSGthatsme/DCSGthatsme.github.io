Rituals are time-consuming [[Abilities]] that take at least one hour to perform. If properly used, a ritual can be a powerful problem-solving tool. Like mystical powers, rituals can cause [[Corruption]]; first when they are learned and then each time they are used. 

A ritual can only be taken via the [[Ritualist]] ability. Note that each ritual is an ability taken at no cost to [[Experience]] except what is spent on Ritualist: 10xp to acquire at novice level, 20xp to increase from novice to adept, and 30xp to increase from adept to master.
