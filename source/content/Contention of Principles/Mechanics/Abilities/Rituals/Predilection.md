## Ability
Crux: [[Exaltation]]

The mystic cherishes a location, shielding it from outside mystical influence. The cherished location blocks rituals like [[Clairvoyance]], [[Summoning]], [[Hound]], and the like, but should any of these rituals be tracking or hunting a person the block is gone as soon as the person leaves the area. Fully Corrupted creatures feel sick when getting close to an area that has been sanctified, and suffer 1D4 damage that ignores [[Toughness]] each round they remain on cherished ground, whereas Corrupted creatures experience a strong discomfort when around sacred locations and objects.
