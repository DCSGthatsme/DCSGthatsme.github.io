## Ability
Crux: [[Exaltation]]

The mystic cherishes a location, shielding it from outside mystical influence. The cherished location blocks rituals like [[Clairvoyance]], [[Summoning]], [[Heretic's Trail]], and the like, but should any of these rituals be tracking or hunting a person the block is gone as soon as the person leaves the area. Abominations (creatures that are members of the Abomination monster category) feel sick when getting close to an area that has been sanctified, and suffer 1D4 damage that ignores Armor each turn they remain on cherished ground. Creatures that are tainted but have not yet turned into a true abomination experience a strong discomfort when around sacred locations and objects. Predilection can also be performed upon a weapon, which is a requirement for the [[Bewitched Hammer]] power.
