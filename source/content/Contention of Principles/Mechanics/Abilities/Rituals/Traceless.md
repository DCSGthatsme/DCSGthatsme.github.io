## Ability
Crux: [[Appreciation]]

All physical traces of the mystic and their allies disappear. For instance, footsteps in mud subside, broken branches and grass stalks heal and spider webs are mystically restored. The ritual works just as well in civilization; dust settles on mosaic floors and piles of paper are arranged as they were before the mystic or some ally browsed them. The duration is 24 hours: the effect can affect all activities performed during the day after the ritual is performed. The effect of the ritual is that neither the mystic nor their allies can be traced by any physical means.
