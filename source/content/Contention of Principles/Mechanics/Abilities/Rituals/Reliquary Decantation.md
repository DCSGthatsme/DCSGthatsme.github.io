## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]

The ritual binds the mystic to a Reliquary Stone, which then works as an extension of the mystic's being. The ritual allows the mystic to move 1D4 points of permanent [[Corruption]] to the [[Reliquary Stone]] with a successful [[Resolve]] test. The stone can hold up to half of the mystic's Resolve in Corruption, rounded down; it darkens as it fills up and detonates if said limit is surpassed. The collected Corruption then rushes back to the mystic, often with a rather nasty result. In the unlikely case that they survive that wave of Corruption, it is possible for the mystic to bind themself to a new Reliquary Stone and start over. The ritual costs one (1) point of [[Experience]] to perform, whether it is successful or not.
