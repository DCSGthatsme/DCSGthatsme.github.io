## Ability
Crux: [[Appreciation]]

The mystic breathes new life into a beautiful location and turns it into a blotch circle. Blotch circles are protected from prying eyes and influences from outside, and the mystic has more or less complete control over what happens within the circle. The mystic decides how things grow and which season it is within, and can with the [[Growth]] ritual create an environment to mirror their heart's delight.

It is hard to find a Blotch Circle, even if you know where to look for it. It requires a \[[[Vigilance]]‚Üê[[Subtlety]]\] test to even see the circle if encountered in the wilderness. Creatures that do not see the circle will simply walk around it, without knowing they have taken a short detour.

A mystic with both the Blotch Circle ritual and the [[Alchemy]] ability can make an extra attempt at Alchemy tests when using the ability inside their circle. A mystic with Growth, Blotch Circle, and Alchemy can make two extra attempts when using Alchemy.

A mystic who performs [[Borrow Beast]] and lets their body rest inside a Blotch Circle has no limitation as to how long it can maintain the trance, since their body gets all the nutrition it needs from the ground inside the circle.
