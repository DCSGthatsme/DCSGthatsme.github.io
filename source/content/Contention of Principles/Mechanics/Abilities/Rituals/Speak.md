## Ability
Crux: [[Appreciation]]

The mystic can engage in conversation with any one thing without a will of its own. With each question, the target can be deceitful or terminate the conversation, if it wishes. If the mystic chooses, they may attempt a [[Resolve]] test as they ask the question to prevent the target from doing so. Once the conversation ends, Speak may not be used on the same target for the rest of the adventure.
