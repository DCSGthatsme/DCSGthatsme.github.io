## Ability
Crux: [[Fear]]

The mystic temporarily transforms their hands to flesh crafting and bone sculpting claw-like instruments, put to work on a more or less willing victim. The work transforms the victim into a grotesque mockery of its former self, possessing one or more monstrous traits at level I from the following list: [[Acidic Blood]], [[Acidic Attack]], [[Armored]], [[Corrupting Attack]], [[Natural Weapon]], [[Poisonous]], [[Poison Spit]], [[Regeneration]], [[Robust]], [[Wings]]. Later, the victim may develop the traits granted by the ritual with [[Experience]], as if they were normal abilities.

A voluntary victim gains 1d4 permanent [[Corruption]] per trait, but is only affected by whatever amount transcends its current value in permanent corruption. An involuntary victim gains 1d4 permanent corruption per trait, which is added to the corruption it already has.

Since the risk of the victim becoming blight born is high, the careful sorcerer always starts off by binding the victim with the ritual [[Enslave]]. With that precaution taken, the newborn abomination will obey its creator after the fall into darkness.
