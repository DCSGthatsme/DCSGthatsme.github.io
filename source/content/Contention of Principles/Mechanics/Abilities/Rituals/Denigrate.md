## Ability
Crux: [[Exaltation]]

The mystic lets pacifying light flow through chains or shackles holding a person. This prevents the shackled person from using [[Mystical Powers]] that require a [[Resolve]] test. The light evaporates from the shackles over time, so the effect must be maintained by a renewed ritual each month.
