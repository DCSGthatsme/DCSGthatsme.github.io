## Ability
Crux: [[Appreciation]]

The mystic can reveal blight-stricken persons or creatures by using incense and making a successful [[Wit]] test. The smoke spreads among those present and gathers around objects and creatures in relation to how corrupted they are: the closer the smoke gathers, the more tainted the creature in question is. The Game Master clearly states if objects or creatures are blight-stricken, blightmarked or thoroughly corrupt.
