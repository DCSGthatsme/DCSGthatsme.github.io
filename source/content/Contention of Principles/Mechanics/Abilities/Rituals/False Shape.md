## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]

The mystic weaves an illusory image around themself or an ally, who then assumes a different physical appearance. This cannot be the appearance of a specific individual. The mystic can decide on form and features, in terms of build, hair color, voice, clothes, et cetera, but the target keeps their stats, abilities, and shadow. Their actual size is not affected, only the size of the illusory appearance. The illusion cannot be revealed without using other powers or rituals. The only exception is if the target tries to do something they normally cannot do, but that the assumed shape could do; then the illusion crumbles. In any case, the False Shape fades away after about a week.
