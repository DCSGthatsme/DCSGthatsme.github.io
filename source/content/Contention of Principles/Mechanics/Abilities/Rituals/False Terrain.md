## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]

The mystic can weave an illusion over a location and completely hide what is truly there. Any creature that comes close can see through the illusion with a successful \[[[Resolve]]‚ÜêResolve\] test. Any creature that either touches or passes through the illusion will, of course, automatically see through the deception. The illusion remains, even if revealed, but fades over time, if not maintained monthly by someone renewing the ritual.
