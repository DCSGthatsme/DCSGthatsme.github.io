## Ability
Crux: [[Exaltation]]

The mystic anoints themself before a battle, thereby gaining the following: +10 temporary [[Health]], +1d4 [[Toughness]], and +1d4 damage on all attacks. If the mystic is damaged, they first lose the temporary Health before their own Health is affected. The downside is that the mystic cannot be healed and that all death tests automatically fail during the scene. The effect lasts for the duration of a scene.
