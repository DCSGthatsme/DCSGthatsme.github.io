## Ability
Crux: [[Exaltation]]

The mystic anoints themself before a battle, thereby gaining the following: +10 temporary Toughness, +1d4 in protection in addition to any Armor worn, and +1d4 damage on all attacks. If the mystic is damaged, they first lose the temporary Toughness before their own Toughness is affected. The downside is that the mystic cannot be healed and that all death tests automatically fail during the scene. The effect lasts for the duration of a scene.
