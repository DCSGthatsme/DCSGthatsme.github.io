## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]

By using this ritual the mystic can observe and listen in on a faraway location, provided that the mystic has personally visited that location before. People at that location with the [[Sublime Sight]] ability can realize that they are being watched if they make a successful \[[[Resolve]]←[[Subtlety]]\] test. Clairvoyance is blocked by the rituals [[Sanctum]], [[Predilection]] and [[Blotch Circle]].
