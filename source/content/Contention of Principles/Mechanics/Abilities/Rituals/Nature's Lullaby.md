## Ability
Crux: [[Appreciation]]

By making a successful [[Resolve]] test the mystic can sing an aspect of dark Davokar to sleep, and can therefore pass by a specific abomination without it reacting â€“ the mystic and their allies becomes more or less invisible to the blighted creature. If the mystic or their allies behave aggressively, then the effect of the ritual is broken. The same happens if the mystic stops singing, to use a mystical power for example.
