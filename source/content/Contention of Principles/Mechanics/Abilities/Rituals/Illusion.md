## Ability
Crux: [[Captivation]]

The mystic creates a false image. This image can move and speak but dissolves if touched by intelligent creatures. The image is completely real until then; it both sounds, smells and appears dangerous. Yet, the image can neither harm nor affect physical objects. The Illusion can only perform simple tasks such as guard a location or go towards a village and howl. The effect is active for one scene or one hour if not dissolved before then.
