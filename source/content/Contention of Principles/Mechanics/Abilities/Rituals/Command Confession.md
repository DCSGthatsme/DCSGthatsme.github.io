## Ability
Crux: [[Exaltation]]

The ritual forces a victim to truthfully answer a number of yes/no questions asked by the mystic. Each question requires a \[[[Resolve]]‚ÜêResolve\] test, and the ritual is disrupted as soon as a test fails. The mystic may not continue to interrogate the victim after that, at least not through the use of this ritual.
