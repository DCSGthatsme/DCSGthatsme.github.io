## Acidic Attack
Either the creature’s unarmed attack or its Natural Weapon is covered in acid so that each hit has a corrosive side effect on the target. The acid must first penetrate the target’s Armor to deal damage, even if the initial attack does. Removing the acid from either body or armor requires that someone spends an Action and makes a successful Wit test. Acidic Attack requires the Acidic Blood trait, at the same level or higher.

I
Reaction. The acidic attack is weak and deals 3 points of damage for 3 turns.

II
Reaction. The acidic attack is moderately strong and deals 4 points of damage for 4 turns.

III
Reaction. The acidic attack is strong and deals 5 points of damage for 5 turns.

## Acidic Blood
The creature’s blood is corrosive, and sprays all around when the creature is hit by attacks. Whoever hits the creature in melee combat, and manages to damage it, must make a Defense test or be hit by the acidic blood. Removing the acid from either body or armor requires that someone spends an Action and makes a successful Wit test (wash it away with water, dirt, sand or something similar).

I
Reaction. The acidic blood is weak and deals 3 points of damage for 3 turns.

II
Reaction. The acidic blood is moderately strong and deals 4 points of damage for 4 turns.

III
Reaction. The acidic blood is strong and deals 5 points of damage for 5 turns.

## Alternative Damage
The creature’s attack harms a specific Attribute instead of Toughness, usually Might or Resolve. If not specified in the monster description, the Game Master decides which one. This kind of damage affects all rolls made using that Attribute.

Alternative Damage heals, and can be healed, just like ordinary damage. If the Attribute reaches 0, the victim’s soul or life force is devoured by the attacker and the victim dies. Alternative Damage requires the monstrous trait Spirit Form.

I
Passive. The creature’s natural weapon deals 3 alternative damage, ignoring Armor.

II
Passive. The creature’s natural weapon deals 4 alternative damage, ignoring Armor.

III
Passive. The creature’s natural weapon deals 5 alternative damage, ignoring Armor.

## Armored
The creature either has thick skin, scales or something else making it especially hard to wound. It cannot wear any additional armor over its natural armor, which, on the other hand, is not Impeding like ordinary armor is. However, the Man-at-arms ability enhances the creature’s protection even further, in addition to its level in Armored.

I
Passive. The creature has a natural protection of 2.

II
Passive. The creature has a natural protection of 3.

III
Passive. The creature has a natural protection of 4.

## Corrupting Attack
Those of Davokar’s creatures that are most corrupted have the ability to spread the dark taint through their claws and other natural weapons.

I
Passive. The creature’s attack oozes corruption and taints all who are wounded by its attacks. A victim that suffers at least 1 point of damage from the attack also suffers 1D4 temporary Corruption.

II
Passive. A victim that suffers at least 1 point of damage from the attack also suffers 1D6 temporary Corruption.

III
Passive. A victim that suffers at least 1 point of damage from the attack also suffers 1D8 temporary Corruption.

## Enthrall
The creature can hypnotize its victims and make them unable to act until it is too late.

I
Active. The creature’s gaze forces its victim to make a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test, or otherwise lose both its Actions in the upcoming turn.

II
Active. The creature’s sweet song or its hypnotic sound forces all its victims to make a \[Resolve← Resolve\] test, or otherwise lose both its Actions in the upcoming turn.

III
Active. As II, but the victims are enthralled until they make a successful \[Resolve←Resolve\] test. The enthrallment is broken if a victim is harmed in any way

## Gravely Cold
Wherever it moves, the creature spreads the cold of the grave around itself like an aura, and everyone in its immediate vicinity is at risk of being affected.

I
Free. The creature spreads the paralyzing cold of the grave; enemies within melee distance are paralyzed, should they fail a Resolve test. One test is made each turn, and should the test be successful, the enemy can act as normal. Once an enemy has withstood the cold of the grave it cannot be affected again during the same scene.

II
Free. As I, but with the addition that the cold is harmful, dealing 2 points of damage per turn to those affected, ignoring Armor.

III
Free. As II, but the cold now affects enemies who fail a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test.

## Manifestation
The creature has disciplined its Spirit Form to the point where it can manifest itself physically for a shorter or longer period of time.

I
Free. The spirit can manifest itself physically for one turn, and thereby act as if it had a physical body. If a turn’s Movement Action(s) is enough to cross water, then the spirit can do so. The spirit can use its unarmed attacks or natural weapons during the turn, but suffers damage from anything that harms physical creatures.

II
Free. The spirit can manifest itself with any weapons and armor it had when it died, and use them in battle. The spirit remains physical for as long as it pleases, but cannot change form in the middle of a turn – if the spirit has started its turn in physical form, then the turn is played in physical form. If it so chooses, the spirit can walk around in physical form for an entire scene, in order to cross water, for example. If the spirit is forced, or chooses, to return to its spectral form while crossing water, it is thrown back to solid ground.

III
Special. The spirit has fully mastered its Manifestation and can act physically with any Actions it chooses, while remaining immaterial in regards to everything else. It can attack physically, yet defends itself like a spirit. The spirit cannot be harmed in any way, besides what is stated in the description of its level of Spirit Form. If it so chooses, the spirit can walk around unhindered in physical form, for a longer journey on a boat, for example. If the spirit is forced, or chooses, to return to its spectral form while crossing water, it is thrown back to solid ground.

## Natural Weapon
The creature is gifted with a well-developed natural weapon, such as sharp claws, teeth or a tail stinger. The Natural Warrior ability (see page 119) can be used to enhance the creature’s Natural Weapon even further.

I
Passive. The creature is equipped with some kind of natural weapon which deals 3 points of damage, instead of the usual 2 for unarmed attacks.

II
Passive. The creature’s natural weapon deals 4 points of damage.

III
Passive. The creature’s natural weapon deals 5 points of damage. The natural weapon now has the quality Long, allowing the creature to perform a Free Attack at the start of a combat against enemies with shorter weapons.

## Poisonous
The creature’s unarmed attack or Natural Weapon is poisonous and each hit that wounds an enemy will also poison it, unless the victim succeeds with a \[Might←Wit\] test. The poison's effect can be cancelled if someone applies an antidote to the wound and succeeds with a Wit test.

I
Passive. The poison is weak and deals 2 points of damage for 2 turns.

II
Passive. The poison is moderately strong and deals 3 points of damage for 3 turns.

III
Passive. The poison is strong and deals 4 points of damage for 4 turns.

## Poison Spit
The creature is not just Poisonous; it can also spit venom at its enemies. The poison attack is performed just like an ordinary ranged attack; if hit the victim must pass a \[Might←Wit] test to avoid being posioned. The venomous spit counts as a ranged attack. The poison's effect can be cancelled if someone applies an antidote and succeeds with a Wit test. Poison Spit requires that the creature has the Poisonous trait at the same level or higher.

I
Active. The poison is weak and deals 2 points of damage from 2 turns.

II
Active. The poison is moderately strong and deals 3 points of damage for 3 turns.

III
Active. The poison is strong and deals 4 points of damage for 4 turns.

## Regeneration
The creature spontaneously heals, without needing to spend either time or power to do so. However, the creature has a weakness, a specific type of damage that it cannot regenerate (which, of course, can be healed in other active ways). The creature must choose a weakness related to some kind of damage it cannot heal automatically. Choose between magical weapons, elemental energies (fire or acid) and damage from either holy or unholy attacks.

I
Passive. Regenerates 2 Toughness per turn.

II
Passive. Regenerates 3 Toughness per turn.

III
Passive. Regenerates 4 Toughness per turn.

## Robust
The creature is bigger and tougher than usual, and can only wear modified light armor.

I
Passive. The creature ignores 2 points of damage from each hit, in addition to any Armor it may wear. Once per turn, the creature deals an additional +2 points of damage with one of its melee attacks. The creature's Defense is calculated from the basis of \Agility−2].

II
Passive. The creature ignores 3 points of damage from each hit, in addition to any Armor it may wear. Once per turn, the creature deals an additional +3 points of damage with one of its melee attacks. The creature's Defense is calculated from the basis of \[Agility−3\].

III
Passive. The creature ignores 4 points of damage from each hit, in addition to any Armor it may wear. Once per turn, the creature deals an additional +4 points of damage with one of its melee attacks. The creature's Defense is calculated from the basis of \[Agility−4\].

## Spirit Form
The creature is a spirit; it is immaterial and can neither affect nor be affected by physical effects. A spirit whose Toughness is brought down to 0 is banished from the area for a shorter or longer period of time. Spirit Form gives access to the Alternative Damage, Manifestation and Terrify monstrous traits.

I
Passive. The creature can pass through barriers without problem, but cannot cross water even by bridges, boat or air. The spirit suffers half damage from weapon attacks. Alchemical effects on weapons and mystical powers deal full damage. Magical weapons deal full damage, as well.

II
Passive. The spirit suffers half damage from weapon attacks, alchemical/mystical attacks as well as from magical weapons.

III
Passive. Only mystical powers and magical weapons can harm the spirit, and then only with half damage.

## Swarm
The creature is a collective, its mind spread among a swarm of bodies. The creature cannot be destroyed unless the entire swarm is obliterated.

I
Special. The swarm suffers half damage from all attacks. If the swarm is damaged, and is brought down to below half its Toughness, the survival instinct of the separate parts of the swarm takes over and its instincts cause the rest of the swarm to flee. A mental attack (where the swarm uses its Resolve to defend itself) affects the entire swarm.

II
Special. The swarm suffers half damage from all attacks. If the swarm suffers damage from a single attack that exceeds its Pain Threshold, the survival instinct of the separate parts of the swarm takes over and its instincts cause the rest of the swarm to flee. Also, the swarm may make two attempts to resist mental attacks (where the swarm uses its Resolve to defend itself).

III
Special. The collective mind of the swarm controls it, so that it only suffers a quarter of any damage taken from attacks. The swarm’s cohesion is complete, and the swarm does not have to flee unless the overall intellect chooses to do so. The swarm may make two attempts to resist mental attacks (where the swarm uses its Resolve to defend itself).

## Terrify
The creature can strike terror into the heart of one or more creatures. Terrify requires that the creature has the monstrous trait Spirit Form.

I
Active. The creature’s gaze forces a single victim to make a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test, or automatically spend both of its actions backing away. If the victim cannot back away, it will defend itself in desperation, but cannot compel itself to attack. The victim may make a test each turn, trying to shrug off the fear.

II
Active. The creature’s horrific shriek forces everyone that is nearby to make a \[Resolve←Resolve\] test, or automatically spend both of their actions backing away. If the victims cannot back away, they will defend themselves in desperation, but cannot compel themselves to attack. The victims may make a test each turn, trying to shrug off the fear.

III
Free. As II, but the victims do not defend themselves against attacks, fleeing if possible, cowering in place if not. The victims may make a test each turn in order to shrug off the paralyzing fear.

## Undead
The creature is a spirit trapped inside a dead body. The spirit controls the slowly decaying corpse and is banished when the body is destroyed.

I
Passive. The undead creature is not affected by poison or diseases, but takes the usual damage from physical effects except that the Pain Threshold is not used (pain and shock do not affect the walking corpse). The walking corpse does not heal naturally and is not affected by alchemical healing elixirs, but must instead eat raw meat (living or recently killed) or drink blood to heal, each point of Toughness that the creature consumes heals it by 2 points of Toughness.

II
Passive. The walking corpse suffers only half damage from ordinary physical effects, such as weapons or elemental damage. Mystical powers that ignore Armor deal full damage as usual.

III
Passive. The walking corpse suffers only half damage from alchemical and mystical effects as well, but takes full damage from magical weapons and holy effects.

## Web
The creature can spin tough webs and use them either passively or actively to capture its prey.

I
Passive. The threads of the web force all who pass through it to make a \[Agility←Wit\] test or get stuck. To get free requires a successful \[Might← Wit\] test, with one test being made each turn. A captured creature cannot move and must roll twice when attempting to perform any Actions – the attempt fails if either of these tests are unsuccessful.

II
Active. Besides passive, pre-fabricated webs (as level I), the creature can now throw a net at an enemy as an Action. The victim can avoid the attack if it makes a successful \[Agility←Exactitude\] test. A captured creature must succeed with a \[Might← Wit\] test in order to break free, with one test allowed per turn. A captured creature cannot move and must roll twice when attempting to perform any Actions – the attempt fails if either of these tests are unsuccessful.

III
Active. The net is almost alive and obeys its creator; it has the passive ability to capture creatures (as level I) but the net can also strike out with up to three (3) threads per turn, with the same effect as level II.

## Wings
The creature is equipped with wings of some kind (either bird or insect-like) and has a more or less developed ability to fly.

I
Passive. The creature can fly during its Movement Action, and therefore avoid Free Attacks when passing over an enemy.

II
Passive. The creature can hover, meaning it can stand still in midair, out of reach from any melee attacks. To hover does not count as an Action.

III
Passive. The creature can make sweeping attacks; it can use a part of its movement before an attack, and the rest afterwards. This way, it does not become bogged down in melee combat, while still being able to perform melee attacks itself
