The character suffers from [leprosy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy) and is more or less openly discriminated against. Some individuals might be less inclined to prejudice, but the character's social interactions are generally hampered. When taking on a social challenge, the player has to roll twice and pick the worst result to decide the outcome of the test.
