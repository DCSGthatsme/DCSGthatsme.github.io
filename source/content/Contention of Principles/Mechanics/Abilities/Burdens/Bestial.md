The player character has a bestial appearance, in the form of one (or a few) conspicuous traits – jakaar eyes, aboar tusks, lindworm scales on arms and neck, or something else arousing fear and disgust. Concealing the traits requires the character to pass a \[Subtlety←Vigilance\] test. If the test is failed, the character will have a second chance at failing all Charisma tests concerning pleas for help or protection. However, the bestial exterior grants a second chance to pass all Charisma tests meant to threaten or intimidate. As soon as they can, those subjected to the character's intimidation – whether or not it is successful – will report them to the Town Watch (or similar authorities) as a suspected abomination.
