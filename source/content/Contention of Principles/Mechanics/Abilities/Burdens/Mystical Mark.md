The character has a mystical mark somewhere on their body, maybe a birth mark or a scar gained later in life. Whatever the origin, the character is at risk of being mistaken for having a blight-mark. In situations when it is relevant, the character must pass a test against \[Subtlety←Vigilance\] or attract the attention of a pitch-fork wielding mob or a more or less dangerous witchhunter.
