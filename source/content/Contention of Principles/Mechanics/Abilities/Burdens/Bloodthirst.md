## Ability
The character has a thirst for blood, easily awoken and hard to quench. The thirst appears if they take damage and means that the character will not spare any enemies â€“ not even if they surrender. Trying to spare an enemy requires an almost overpowering effort; it requires the character to sacrifice an [[Experience]] point and then pass a [[Vigilance]] test.
