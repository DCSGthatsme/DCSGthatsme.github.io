There are limits to how much a character can carry. Each item incurs +1 Encumbrance, except in the following cases:
* Clothing, belts, and boots do not incur Encumbrance.
* Backpacks, sacks, shoulder-bags, and other light containers do not not incur Encumbrance; only their contents do. Barrels, chests, boxes, and other bulky containers incur Encumbrance in addition to what they contain.
* Small objects do not incur Encumbrance unless one carries a lot of them.
* Equipped armor does not incur Encumbrance. Armor which is carried but not equipped incurs Encumbrance equal to its [[Impedance]] value.
* Weapons equipped in a character's hands do not incur Encumbrance. Weapons carried in a pack or in their sheaths do incur Encumbrance.
* Items with the quality [[Massive]] incur +2 Encumbrance.

If the character bears an Encumbrance greater than their [[Encumbrance Threshold]], they get [[Impedance]] (-1) *for each Encumbrance above their Encumbrance Threshold*.

If a character bears an Encumbrance greater than their [[Carrying Limit]], they cannot move more than short distances at a time. They are forced to suffer the detriments of a Hasty March during a Cautious March and cannot partake in a Hasty March. Furthermore, the heavy load gives a -1 detriment to the [[Might]] roll for a Hasty March to see if they take an extra 1d6 damage *for each Encumbrance above their Carrying Limit*.
