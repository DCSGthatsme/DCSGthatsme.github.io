The first step to character creation is to fill out the [[Character Template]], which the Game Master will guide you through.
## Attributes
The character's [[Attributes]] should be determined by your finished character template.
## Items
All characters start with 50 [[Days' Rations]], a sleeping roll, cooking equipment, and firewood. Trinkets and memorabilia suited to the characterâ€™s backstory may be added at no cost.

All characters begin with a dagger. Additionally, the character receives any weapons associated with Abilities they acquire in character creation. If they do not take any such Ability, they may instead take a staff, a single-handed weapon, or a ranged weapon.

The character starts with a light armor. If a player should want heavier armor, then they have to purchase it with their starting funds. It may be wise to purchase armor with a low [[Impeding]], should you be able to afford it.
## Abilities
You get 60 [[Experience]] which you may spend on [[Abilities]]. No Ability may be increased to Master. You must not have any remaining XP. Note that this is the only time to freely consider [[Features]].
