## Character
 [[Character Template]]

`tribe?`

You may fill in your characteristics (physical, identifying) (name, age, pronouns, physical specifications). Return once more after completing the rest of character creation to fill out or tweak.

`Relationships/bonds between PCs?`
## Mechanics
Distribute the values: 5, 7, 9, 10, 10, 11, 13, 15 among your character's Attributes.

You get 60 [[Experience]] which you may spend on [[Abilities]]. No Ability may be increased to Master. You must not have any remaining XP. Note that this is the only time to freely consider [[Features]].

`starting items`
## Ideas
* Character <-> Mechanics integration
	* something like the bonds system in Nobilis?
		* for a to-hit system: save the difference of a relevant failing roll to add to another roll later, inspiration-style
	* Player choice on how hard each flaw detriments, with more reward for higher hurt
		* maybe have a set spread of detriment effects, where each player must associate each effect with a flaw of theirs
		* XP can be a cut-and-dry reward
		* Tragedy Points
			* Set certain detriments, based on your flaws, to have a negative modifier on certain situational checks. When it creates a meaningful detriment, gain the modifier's amount of Tragedy Points. They may be spent for a positive modifier or spent for XP. `what ratios`
* Any chosen magic at character creation: instant big number permanent Corruption
