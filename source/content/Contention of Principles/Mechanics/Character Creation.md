## Character
Allow me to introduce the world.

I need to do a really good job of setting the tone. Make sure players understand that the player characters aren't very exceptional. They are not heroes or adventurers. They're not supernatural and they are far from being moral, virtuous people. They are meddlesome and reprobate by our standards.

Follow [[Character]].

`tribe?`

You may fill in your characteristics (physical, identifying) (name, age, pronouns, physical specifications). Return once more after completing the rest of character creation to fill out or tweak.

`Relationships/bonds between PCs?`
## Mechanics
Distribute the values: 5, 7, 9, 10, 10, 11, 13, 15 among your character's Attributes.

Choose traits `determine tribal relevance, probably describe some of the larger tribes and the traits available to them`

For abilities, boons, and burdens, you get 50XP. No ability may be increased to Master. You must not have any remaining XP.

`determine the role of magic in character creation`

`starting items`
## Ideas
* Character <-> Mechanics integration
	* something like the bonds system in Nobilis?
		* for a to-hit system: save the difference of a relevant failing roll to add to another roll later, inspiration-style
	* Player choice on how hard each flaw detriments, with more reward for higher hurt
		* maybe have a set spread of detriment effects, where each player must associate each effect with a flaw of theirs
		* XP can be a cut-and-dry reward
		* Tragedy Points
			* Set certain detriments, based on your flaws, to have a negative modifier on certain situational checks. When it creates a meaningful detriment, gain the modifier's amount of Tragedy Points. They may be spent for a positive modifier or spent for XP. `what ratios`
* Any chosen magic at character creation: instant big number permanent corruption
