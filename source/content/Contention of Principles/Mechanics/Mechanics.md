## [[Attributes]]
Attributes represent a character's basic aptitudes. The main attributes are Agility, Charisma, Exactitude, Resolve, Might, Subtlety, Vigilance, and Wit. The Toughness, Pain Threshold, Defense, and Corruption Threshold attributes are derived from the main attributes.

Used in a "success test". The test is successful if 1d20 ≤ (tester's attribute score + modifier).

Difficulty Modifier: +5 (very easy) to -5 (very hard)
Opposition Modifier: Based on the relevant attribute score of the opposition. Calculated: 10 - the opposition's attribute score.

| Score | Modifier |
| ----- | -------- |
| 5     | +5       |
| 6     | +4       |
| 7     | +3       |
| 8     | +2       |
| 9     | +1       |
| 10    | 0        |
| 11    | -1       |
| 12    | -2       |
| 13    | -3       |
| 14    | -4       |
| 15    | -5       |
> When a challenge is described in the text of this book it is always written with the character’s Attribute first, like this: \[Character’s Attribute←Modifier\]. When the modification originates from passive resistance, as in the case of a lock, it is instead written \[Character’s Attribute -Modification X\]. Finally, if the test is meant to be performed without any modifications the relevant Attribute is written in plain text with an initial capital letter: Agility.

`[Atr1<-Atr2] read "tester's Atr1 score modified by opposition's Atr2 modifier"`
`[Attribute-Difficulty] read "tester's Attribute score modified by -Difficulty"`

Note that Attributes can be increased via the [[Abilities#Exceptional Attribute|Exceptional Attribute]] Ability.
## [[Abilities]]
Some abilities are gained at character creation. Abilities may be gained or improved using Experience. Traits are abilities that are only gained or improved during character creation, as dictated by race.
* Active Action: The ability is an attack or similar Combat Action. Some of the active abilities generate extra Actions. These extra Actions may not be used to perform an additional active Action, but they benefit from any passive abilities that the character may have.
* Free Action: This Action may be used an unlimited number of times per turn in addition to a character’s usual two Actions, for as long as it is allowed by any conditions specified in the description of the ability.
* Passive Action: The ability does not require a Combat Action to be activated; in other words, the ability is always active. If a character has two or more passive abilities, then they are all considered active at the same time.
* Reaction: The ability is a Reaction to some other Action and therefore doesn’t count against the two Actions a character can perform each turn. Reactive Actions work outside the usual order of Initiative, since a Reaction is performed as a consequence of a triggering Action, regardless of Initiative. Reactions can always make use of passive abilities, but never active ones.
* Special Action: The ability works in a special way, detailed in its description.

> Some abilities can be used “once per adventure.” This can be handled in two ways, depending on what the gaming group prefers. If the characters also have active periods in-between adventures, where they engage in various activities (working, running a business or something like that), these abilities may be rolled during that time frame; some characters spend the down-time in their laboratory, their smithy and so on. If the group is totally committed to continuous adventuring it may be necessary to roll for these abilities at the start of each new adventure, or to find a practical situation during the adventure.
### [[Boons]] 
Minor abilities costing less XP.
### [[Burdens]]
Detrimental abilities that grant an XP cost reduction to an ability, rather than costing XP.
### [[Traits]]
Abilities that are compulsory or optional for certain races.
### [[Mystical Powers]]
Mystical powers are magical abilities. Each mystical power is a variant of the [[Abilities#Mystical Power|Mystical Power]] ability.
### [[Principle Bond]]
Principle Bonds are abilities that are highly suggest for characters who intend to learn and use many Mystical Powers.
### [[Rituals]]
Rituals are magical abilities. Learning rituals requires the [[Abilities#Ritualist|Ritualist]] ability.
## Experience
> 1 per scene, but I have my players roll 1d4 as a bonus if they do something really cool or intense. Also, for the big bad boss I give out 1d10 extra xp

`determine when xp may be spent (no existing rule)`

Purchasing a new ability at novice level costs 10 Experience. To increase a novice ability to the adept level costs 20 Experience. To increase an adept ability to the master level costs 30 Experience.

Purchasing a boon costs 5xp. Gaining a burden reduces the cost of a boon or ability by 5xp.

Re-roll for Experience (Optional Rule):
> All rolls can be re-rolled at the cost of one (1) point of Experience, which is permanently spent. Only one re-roll per Action is allowed. This rule increases the chance of survival for the player characters, which can be a good thing, especially if combined with the rules for instant kill and/ or Perfect Hits and Fumbled Defense (see below). In the latter case, the group must agree which rolls can be re-rolled by spending Experience, and which cannot. The group has to decide:
> 	Can you re-roll a Death Test? (Recommendation: No)
> 	Can you re-roll a fumbled Defense? (Recommendation: No)

## Notes
* Incidence or "go time" instead of combat, acting order instead of initiative order, acting precedence instead of initiative
* filter out spells
	* more low fantasy: resurrection, teleportation, supernatural detection
	* "death is permanent"
* instead of taking particular spells, select certain "pools" and casting magic takes a semi-random card like Legendary's Investigate. Alleviates character creation choice paralysis
