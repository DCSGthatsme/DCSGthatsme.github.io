> When a challenge is described in the text of this book it is always written with the character’s Attribute first, like this: \[Character’s Attribute←Modifier\]. When the modification originates from passive resistance, as in the case of a lock, it is instead written \[Character’s Attribute -Modification X\]. Finally, if the test is meant to be performed without any modifications the relevant Attribute is written in plain text with an initial capital letter: Agility.

`[Atr1<-Atr2] read "tester's Atr1 score modified by opposition's Atr2 modifier"`
`[Attribute-Difficulty] read "tester's Attribute score modified by -Difficulty"`

Note that Attributes can be increased via the [[Abilities#Exceptional Attribute|Exceptional Attribute]] Ability.

## [[Abilities]]
Some abilities are gained at character creation. Abilities may be gained or improved using Experience. Traits are abilities that are only gained or improved during character creation, as dictated by race.
* Active Action: The ability is an attack or similar Combat Action. Some of the active abilities generate extra Actions. These extra Actions may not be used to perform an additional active Action, but they benefit from any passive abilities that the character may have.
* Free Action: This Action may be used an unlimited number of times per turn in addition to a character’s usual two Actions, for as long as it is allowed by any conditions specified in the description of the ability.
* Passive Action: The ability does not require a Combat Action to be activated; in other words, the ability is always active. If a character has two or more passive abilities, then they are all considered active at the same time.
* Reaction: The ability is a Reaction to some other Action and therefore doesn’t count against the two Actions a character can perform each turn. Reactive Actions work outside the usual order of Initiative, since a Reaction is performed as a consequence of a triggering Action, regardless of Initiative. Reactions can always make use of passive abilities, but never active ones.
* Special Action: The ability works in a special way, detailed in its description.

> Some abilities can be used “once per adventure.” This can be handled in two ways, depending on what the gaming group prefers. If the characters also have active periods in-between adventures, where they engage in various activities (working, running a business or something like that), these abilities may be rolled during that time frame; some characters spend the down-time in their laboratory, their smithy and so on. If the group is totally committed to continuous adventuring it may be necessary to roll for these abilities at the start of each new adventure, or to find a practical situation during the adventure.
### [[Boons]] 
Minor abilities costing less XP.
### [[Burdens]]
Detrimental abilities that grant an XP cost reduction to an ability, rather than costing XP.
### [[Traits]]
Abilities that are compulsory or optional for certain races.
### [[Mystical Powers]]
Mystical Powers are magical abilities. To gain a mystical power requires the [[Abilities#Mystical Power|Mystical Power]] ability:
![[Abilities#Mystical Power]]

Additionally, the associated [[Principle Bond]] ability is highly recommended for mystics making heavy use of a school.
![[Principle Bond#Abilities]]
#### [[Rituals]]
Rituals are magical abilities. Learning rituals requires the [[Abilities#Ritualist|Ritualist]] ability:
![[Abilities#Ritualist]]

Note that each ritual is a free ability granted by Ritualist (under proper conditions), as opposed to a version of the Ritualist ability like the mystical powers.
### Principle Bonds
Principle Bonds are abilities that are highly suggested for characters who intend to learn and use many mystical powers.

## Experience
> 1 per scene, but I have my players roll 1d4 as a bonus if they do something really cool or intense. Also, for the big bad boss I give out 1d10 extra xp

`determine when xp may be spent (no existing rule)`

Purchasing a new ability at novice level costs 10 Experience. To increase a novice ability to the adept level costs 20 Experience. To increase an adept ability to the master level costs 30 Experience.

Purchasing a boon costs 5xp. Gaining a burden reduces the cost of a boon or ability by 5xp.

Re-roll for Experience (Optional Rule):
> All rolls can be re-rolled at the cost of one (1) point of Experience, which is permanently spent. Only one re-roll per Action is allowed. This rule increases the chance of survival for the player characters, which can be a good thing, especially if combined with the rules for instant kill and/ or Perfect Hits and Fumbled Defense (see below). In the latter case, the group must agree which rolls can be re-rolled by spending Experience, and which cannot. The group has to decide:
> 	Can you re-roll a Death Test? (Recommendation: No)
> 	Can you re-roll a fumbled Defense? (Recommendation: No)
## [[Character Creation]]
![[Character Creation#Mechanics]]
## Go-time
When an combat encounter suggests a quantity of opponents based on the number of player characters (e.g. \[PC+2\] Robbers), companions such as a Familiar, Flaming Servant, or Patron Saint should be counted among the characters. This also pertains to longstanding NPCs who are effectively members of the adventuring party, so long as they are equipped to affect the outcome of the fight.

When go-time begins, the character with the highest Agility can choose to either act first or to wait. You may choose to place your acting precedence later in the turn order, but once the acting order is established it cannot be changed. If two characters have the same Agility value, then compare Vigilance. If they still share the same value, determine it randomly with an appropriate roll.

Combat With Weapons Ready
When go-time combat begins, it is important to know whether the actors have their weapons drawn or not. Also, remember that Long weapons get a Free Attack against one enemy during the first `turn? round?` of melee go-time, provided that the enemy does not have a Long weapon as well.

Surprise
It usually requires a successful \[Subtlety←Vigilance\] test to surprise someone. If a group tries to surprise another group, instead of individual against individual, use the attackers' lowest Subtlety modified by the defenders’ highest Vigilance. They who surprises an enemy is allowed to make one Free Attack against the enemy at the start of the turn. After that, follow the regular acting order, based on the actors' Agility values, as described above. If any of the combatants are surprised at the start of combat, they must draw their weapons. All Short weapons can be unsheathed as a Free Action. To unsheathe a weapon is otherwise considered a Movement Action. Another option is of course to not draw any weapons and instead choose to use unarmed attacks; an individual's or creature's natural weapons are always considered ready.

Actions in Go-time

In go-time combat, your character will kick and fight, slash and stab, parry and dodge. The character does this with his or her two Actions per turn; one Combat Action and one Movement Action. The Combat Action can be replaced with an additional Movement Action, and Movement Actions can be replaced by other kinds of Actions.
Besides Combat and Movement Actions, every actor may perform Reactive Actions, such as performing Free Attacks and Defense tests. There are also Free Actions, Actions that are either brief or can be made in parallel with other Actions. All Actions, except Reactions, are performed on the character’s Initiative. Reactions are performed as it sounds, as a reaction to an enemy’s Action or other circumstances.

Combat Action
The most important Action that can be performed in a turn is the attack. It is with this Action that you character attacks its enemies and attempts to harm them with its weapon. The attack is preferably performed with an Active ability, if your character masters such a skill. Passive abilities always act together with active ones.
The attack is made with \[Exactitude←Defense\]. Note that some abilities can allow you to attack using other Attributes besides Exactitude, and calculate Defense using something else than Agility.
A Combat Action does not have to be an attack. To provide first aid to someone or to use any other active ability also counts as a Combat Action.
A Combat Action can be replaced with an additional Movement Action, but not the opposite: a Movement Action cannot be replaced with an additional Combat Action.

Movement Action
The Movement Action represents a meaningful movement in go-time. The Movement Action is done on a character’s acting precedence. Normally, the exact distance is not of any great importance. What does matter in combat is who can make a melee attack and who can use ranged attacks. If a more exact distance needs to be calculated, then a Movement Action represents 10 paces (10 meters), but characters who engage an enemy in melee combat naturally stop by the enemy if the distance is shorter than that (in other words, the character does not have to move the full 10 paces). Movement Actions are used to: ◆ Reach an enemy and engage it in melee combat. ◆ Take up a flanking position next to an enemy already fighting an ally. ◆ Move past an enemy to reach another one that stands further away (enemies that are bypassed may perform a Free Attack). ◆ Withdraw from melee combat (which allows the enemy to perform a Free Attack against the character). If fighting multiple enemies, then each enemy is allowed a Free Attack. ◆ Create a clear line of sight to an obscured enemy. Instead of moving, the Movement Action can be used to perform other kinds of Actions: ◆ Switch weapons ◆ Stand up from a prone position (requires an Agility test). ◆ Drink/apply an elixir to yourself.
Example: Our dear ogre is considered flanked, since she is standing between two brigands – meaning that the brigands have an Advantage against the big brute. Grumpa solves this with a Movement Action, which trig- gers a Free Attack from each of her enemies (lucky that Grumpa confused one of them!). The ogre moves around the confused enemy, and receives a Free Attack from the other brigand. After making her move, the ogre has both the brigands in front of her, and is no longer flanked. reaCtionS Reactions are quick responses or follow-ups to other Actions or circumstances. They can be performed at any time during the turn and are not tied to the character’s Initiative. The character can perform as many Reactions as is called for per turn, as long as there are triggers to react to. Reactions can use the effect of passive abilities, but not of active ones. free attaCk There are situations when your character will have the opportunity to make a Free Attack with his or her weapon. This most commonly happens when the character is armed with a Long weapon, when an enemy tries to flee from an ongoing melee combat or when an opponent tries to run past the character in order to reach someone or something behind it. There are also some abilities which trigger Free Attacks under special circumstances. Free attacks can use the effect of passive abilities but not of active ones, and normally the character can only gain one Free Attack per triggering factor and turn – if two enemies try to withdraw from melee only 1 Free Attack is gained, but if one withdraws and one runs past, the character gains one Free Attack on each.
## Notes
* Incidence or "go time" instead of combat, acting order instead of initiative order, acting precedence instead of initiative
* filter out spells
	* more low fantasy: resurrection, teleportation, supernatural detection
	* "death is permanent"
* instead of taking particular spells, select certain "pools" and casting magic takes a semi-random card like Legendary's Investigate. Alleviates character creation choice paralysis
