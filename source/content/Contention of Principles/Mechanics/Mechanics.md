## [[Attributes]]
Attributes represent a character's basic aptitudes. The main attributes are Agility, Charisma, Exactitude, Resolve, Might, Subtlety, Vigilance, and Wit. The Toughness, Pain Threshold, Defense, and Corruption Threshold attributes are derived from the main attributes.

Used in a "success test". The test is successful if 1d20 ≤ (tester's attribute score + modifier).

Difficulty Modifier: +5 (very easy) to -5 (very hard)
Opposition Modifier: Based on the relevant attribute score of the opposition. Calculated: 10 - the opposition's attribute score.

| Score | Modifier |
| ----- | -------- |
| 5     | +5       |
| 6     | +4       |
| 7     | +3       |
| 8     | +2       |
| 9     | +1       |
| 10    | 0        |
| 11    | -1       |
| 12    | -2       |
| 13    | -3       |
| 14    | -4       |
| 15    | -5       |
> When a challenge is described in the text of this book it is always written with the character's Attribute first, like this: \[Character's Attribute←Modifier\]. When the modification originates from passive resistance, as in the case of a lock, it is instead written \[Character's Attribute -Modification X\]. Finally, if the test is meant to be performed without any modifications the relevant Attribute is written in plain text with an initial capital letter: Agility.

`[Atr1<-Atr2] read "tester's Atr1 score modified by opposition's Atr2 modifier"`
`[Attribute-Difficulty] read "tester's Attribute score modified by -Difficulty"`

Note that Attributes can be increased via the [[Abilities#Exceptional Attribute|Exceptional Attribute]] Ability.
