## [[Attributes]]
Attributes represent a character's basic aptitudes. The main attributes are Agility, Charisma, Exactitude, Resolve, Might, Subtlety, Vigilance, and Wit. The Toughness, Pain Threshold, Defense, and Corruption Threshold attributes are derived from the main attributes.

Used in a "success test". The test is successful if 1d20 ≤ (tester's attribute score + modifier).

Difficulty Modifier: +5 (very easy) to -5 (very hard)
Opposition Modifier: Based on the relevant attribute score of the opposition. Calculated: 10 - the opposition's attribute score.

| Score | Modifier |
| ----- | -------- |
| 5     | +5       |
| 6     | +4       |
| 7     | +3       |
| 8     | +2       |
| 9     | +1       |
| 10    | 0        |
| 11    | -1       |
| 12    | -2       |
| 13    | -3       |
| 14    | -4       |
| 15    | -5       |
> When a challenge is described in the text of this book it is always written with the character's Attribute first, like this: \[Character's Attribute←Modifier\]. When the modification originates from passive resistance, as in the case of a lock, it is instead written \[Character's Attribute -Modification X\]. Finally, if the test is meant to be performed without any modifications the relevant Attribute is written in plain text with an initial capital letter: Agility.

`[Atr1<-Atr2] read "tester's Atr1 score modified by opposition's Atr2 modifier"`
`[Attribute-Difficulty] read "tester's Attribute score modified by -Difficulty"`

Note that Attributes can be increased via the [[Abilities#Exceptional Attribute|Exceptional Attribute]] Ability.

Damage & Healing
Damage lowers the victim's Toughness and an actor dies when their Toughness reaches zero – unless it is a player character, in which case they are regarded as being dying instead. Damage and wounds can be healed in a number of ways, described in this section.

Toughness
The character's `Max?` Toughness is equal to their Might, but not lower than 10.

Pain Threshold
A character's Pain Threshold is half of their Might, rounded up. When a creature suffers damage from a single that exceeds their Pain Threshold, one of the following things happens. In the case of a player character taking or inflicting the damage, that player chooses which one happens.
* The affected creature is knocked down and has to get up (see Special Actions).
* The one who deals the damage is allowed to perform an immediate Free Attack against the affected creature.

Dying Characters
Monsters and non-player characters die as soon as their Toughness reaches 0, unless the Game Master wants something else to happen. In any case, the rules for player characters are different.

When a player character reaches 0 Toughness, they collapse and are considered to be dying. At this point, they cannot help themself in any way. Each turn thereafter the player is forced to make a Death Test with 1D20 on the character's Initiative. This test is repeated until someone else either stabilizes the dying character with an herbal cure, the Medicus ability or mystical healing – or until the player rolls a 1 and wakes up, or a 20 and dies.

Death test (1D20)
1
The character's damage looked much worse than it actually was; the character wakes up with 1D4 Toughness left. The character can act the next turn.

2–10
The character remains at death's threshold.

11–19 The character is a step closer to death. The third time the roll has this outcome, the character dies.

20
The character dies, but may say some last harsh words if the player wants to.

Dead Player Characters

Dead player characters cannot remain in the game, but the player may create a new character using all the Experience accumulated by the last character.

Healing Wounds
Healing can happen naturally, by the use of alchemy and medicine or with the help of mystical powers. Performing first aid on a dying person requires the Medicus ability, an herbal cure or powers of healing.
* Natural healing happens at a rate of one (1) point of Toughness per day.
* Alchemical herbal cures heal one (1) point of Toughness immediately.
* The Medicus ability heals 1D4 Toughness, even more when combined with herbal cures.
* Mystical powers, such as Lay on Hands, and the Recovery ability both heal Toughness; see their respective descriptions for details.

Special Actions
The conditions of the combat situation and the weapons of the combatants will affect the course of events. Special rules for line of sight, the use of shields as well as different kinds of advantages are covered in this section.

Note that there are many abilities that affect the character's capacity to perform Special Actions. For example, an adept in Acrobatics can get up from lying down as a Free Action, provided that they succeed with an Agility test. And the master level of Sixth Sense removes any negative modifications from Blind Fighting – which can be used when attacking opponents in the dark.

Blind Fighting
To fight blinded is hard, and the same goes for fighting under bad lighting conditions such as in darkness, smoke or thick fog. If both parties in a battle are affected, then no adjustments are needed. Otherwise, the affected party gets two chances to fail their success tests – if the character is affected, the player rolls twice and picks the worst result; if only the enemy is affected the player rolls twice and picks the best result.

Disengage From Melee Combat
Disengaging from a melee combat is done on the character's Initiative and costs a Movement Action. The enemy is allowed a Free Attack against the character. This also applies to situations when the character is facing multiple opponents, in which case each opponent is allowed a Free Attack against the character when they choose to disengage.

Use/Apply Elixir
To use or apply an elixir on either yourself or your equipment counts as a Movement Action. To use or apply it on somebody else counts as a Combat Action.

First Aid
To perform first aid on a wounded person counts as a Combat Action and requires a herbal cure, the Medicus ability or other healing powers. The effect of first aid is described in Damage & Healing.

Stand
Fighting while lying down is possible, but not recommended, because each enemy that has engaged the character in close combat gets an Advantage against a prone character. See rules for Advantage below. If the character makes a successful test against Agility it only takes a Movement Action for the character to get back on their feet. Otherwise, it takes an entire turn, meaning that the character cannot perform a Combat Action while getting up.

Line of Sight
Ranged weapons cannot shoot past other combat- ants, meaning that the shooter (or the mystic) may need to use Movement Actions to maneuver for them to have line of sight. A rule of thumb is that if a shooter or a mystic stands behind an ally so that the targeted enemy is forced to trigger a Free Attack to reach the shooter, then the target is obscured from view by the shooter's ally.

Shield
Anyone can defend themselves with a shield, pro- viding +1 to Defense. The use of a shield makes it impossible to use ranged and Heavy weapons and neutralizes the reach advantage gained from a Long weapon, since the wielder must use it in one hand. The buckler is an exception to this, allowing the use of both hands, as well as giving the user +1 to Defense.

Flank
To surround the enemy is an effective combat strategy. If two persons flank an enemy, both of them gain an Advantage against the target. A maximum of four persons can surround a person or creature; any combatant beyond that will be unable to reach the target and can only step forward if one of their allies retreats or goes down. Terrain and the movement of the combatant decide what is possible to achieve. Doors, corridors and narrow passages can be used to prevent enemies from flanking. Remember that attempting to move past an enemy triggers a Free Attack. The Free Attack can be avoided if the combatant opts to trade their Combat Action that turn for an additional Movement Action, making it possible to go around the enemy without entering into melee.

Surprised
To sneak up on an enemy or prepare an ambush is an active Action and requires a successful \[Subtlety←Vigilance\] test. Attacking an enemy that is unaware of the incoming attack allows the attacker to make a Free Attack in the first turn of combat. Then the combat follows the usual turn order, based on the combatants' Agility.

Advantage
Sometimes one side of a melee combat gets an advantage over the other. A character sneaking up on an enemy to attack it from behind has the Advantage. Another situation where you are at an Advantage is when you attack a target lying on the ground or a target that is climbing towards you. To create advantages when fighting on plain and even ground requires the use of Actions, attacks or movements. If your character has the Advantage in a combat situation, it receives a +2 modification to the relevant Attribute when making a Success test, and their attacks deal 1D4 extra damage. The following situations provide advantages:
* Attacking an enemy that is unaware of the pending attack. For this situation to occur, a successful \[Subtlety←Vigilance\] test is normally required by the attacker.
* All melee attacks against a flanked enemy counts as providing an Advantage. A target is considered flanked if two enemies stand on opposite sides of it. It usually takes a Movement Action to get around an enemy and flank it. In the same way a character can use a Movement Action to get away from a flanked position – but with the consequence of receiving a Free attack from each enemy.
* All melee attacks against an enemy lying down. Note that ranged attacks do not get any advantage from this.
* All attacks against enemies standing on lower ground than the attacker, such as attacking down from a wall against enemies climbing a ladder. This applies to both melee and ranged attacks. Combat Map It can help to have a map of the battle- field in order to get a better overview of the combat situation. Draw the surrounding area on a piece of paper and mark where everybody stands with an “X” or simple markers or tokens. Even objects and terrain – such as trees, boulders and buildings – should be drawn on the map. Then it quickly becomes much more obvious where the combatants stand, who can shoot, who is flanked and so on. A combat map is even more recommended for battles with many combatants, such as in combat situations where the characters face the same number of enemies as themselves.

Problem-solving
Problem-solving refers to situations where your character attempts to achieve something that requires dice rolls and Success tests, but which is not a combat-situation: tracking a fleeing enemy, picking a lock, persuading a guard to let you in or researching the answer to a riddle in a library. The Game Master handles most of this; as a player you only have to be ready to describe how your character attempts to solve the problem, and then roll the dice to make the test asked for by the Game Master.

Social Challenges
Social challenges consist of important negotiations, often involving the great and powerful personas, groups and monsters of the game world – situations that are unfit for combat and cannot be solved with a mere Charisma test. In short, the social challenge is solved by your and your friends' roleplaying, where you will have to persuade, deceive and bargain your way to a solution. The Game Master handles the parameters for the social challenge, while you portray your character and together with your fellow players try to carry through a successful negotiation around the gaming table. Social challenges are often preceded by scenes of problem-solving, where the character gathers information, secrets and rumors that can be used against the one they need to persuade.

Encumbrance
For the gaming groups who like the idea, an encum- brance rule may be introduced, specifying how much characters can carry without being hampered. There are limits to how much a character can carry. To decide if he or she becomes exhausted by moving around laden with treasures, masterly crafted barbarian axes or gold-plated armor, the items are abstractly measured in numbers rather than in weight. A character can carry a number of items mirroring his or her Strong value without being negatively affected. If the character carries more, each extra item gives a –1 modification to Defense, just like the impeding effect of armor. A character can carry a maximum of Strong ×2 items; after that he or she cannot move more than short distances at a time. With the boon Pack-mule, the encumbrance limit is calculated as Strong x1.5 instead, rounded down. Besides these basics the following applies:
* Clothing, belts and boots do not count as carried items
* Backpacks, sacks, shoulder-bags and other light containers do not count as items; only the contents are counted
* Barrels, chests, boxes and other bulky containers count as items in their own right, adding to what they contain
* Smaller objects (coins, pendants, jewels) weigh nothing unless one carries a lot of them; they count as one carried item for every 50 pieces
* Armor worn for protection does not count in this case; it has an impeding value instead. Armor which is carried but not worn for protection correspond to a number of items equal to its impeding value
* Weapons held in a character’s hands do not count as carried items (but signal hostility). Weapons carried in the pack, in their sheaths or similar are encumbering.
* Weapons with the quality Massive count as two items.

A character who carries more than allowed will also have a hard time keeping pace during longer marches – the categories in table 27 on page 184 in Symbaroum’s Core Rulebook grow one tier worse when a character carries too much. A Day’s March counts as a Forced March, and a Forced March counts as a Death March. An encumbered character cannot travel at true Death March pace. Furthermore, the heavy load gives a –1 modification per extra item to Strong when rolling to see if the Death March results in 1 or 1+1d6 damage per day’s travel.

Traps
Trained as well as untrained characters can set traps, in order to protect a location or slow an enemy down. Here follows rules on portable traps and those which may be constructed on location. Specific traps are described in the chapter Equipment on page 127. Setting a Trap With a passed Cunning test, the character can set a ready-made trap. Untrained individuals (i.e. those who do not have the ability Trapper) can only set mechanical traps, which require a passed Cunning test. If the outcome of the test is 20, the trap is sprung in their faces. Trained trappers can ready both mechanical traps and alchemical mines with a combat action, and they can also craft improvised traps. This requires the ability Trapper, or Pyrotechnics if only using alchemical mines. Discovering a Trap Anyone at risk of activating a trap discovers it with a passed \[Vigilant←Discreet\] test. Bypassing a Trap A discovered trap can be bypassed in two ways: It can be jumped over as part of a movement action, which requires a \[Quick←Cunning\] test. If the test fails, the trap is sprung and the character is caught by it, i.e. movement is interrupted. If the terrain allows, a trap can always be ignored by going around it. This costs an extra movement action, or more depending on the terrain. Disarming a Trap A discovered trap can also be disarmed. An untrained individual cannot disarm traps – they have to incapacitate them by shooting or poking at them with a long instrument (the quality Long). The procedure counts as a combat action and requires a passed \[Accurate←Cunning\] test. An individual with the ability Trapper can roll a \[Cunning←Cunning\] test to disarm a trap, and does not require an instrument with the quality Long to do so. Getting Free from a Trap Traps often deal damage, specified in the description of the trap or, in the case of improvised traps, in the description of the ability Trapper. Furthermore, if the trap has such qualities it may hold the victim in place. If so, this is mentioned in the description, combined with information on what it takes to get free.

Trade in Used Goods and Treasures
Sometimes the player characters will want to sell goods in the form of used weapons and armor. Merchants will gladly buy such secondhand items at half of the listed price (then give them a polish and sell them to someone else at full price).

Maneuvers
For gaming groups looking to add more tactical choices to the game, maneuvers may be an attractive addition, giving more options to everyone involved in combat. Of course, a drawback is that this makes combat scenes much more complicated, both with regard to the number of choices that players have to make and the book-keeping required by the Game Master. In essence, it will take longer to play out a combat scene; some gaming groups see this as a benefit, others do not. In some cases, maneuvers work much like abilities and can blur the line between abilities and tactical choices available to everyone. Sure, the abilities are always much more powerful, but you should still take some time to discuss if you want to add this mechanic or not. Some of the maneuvers will only be useful if the gaming group also uses the optional rule Movement by Scale (page 181 in the Core Rulebook), or is at least willing to play with a simplified Combat map (page 162 in the Core Rulebook). Here follows a list of maneuvers that all characters and opponents may employ, hoping to improve their own position or make things harder for the enemy.
Careful Aiming
You take the time to aim carefully with a ranged weapon and get a second chance to pass the attack test. The cost is a movement action, meaning that you cannot move during the turn.
Charge
You charge at the enemy and make a double movement plus a combat action in melee. The charge must be in a straight line towards the target. If the attack test fails, the target gets to make a Free Attack.
Delay the Initiative
You choose to delay your initiative during the turn, to let someone else go first. When it is your time to act, you specify who will get to act before you. The next turn, you are back at your normal place in the order of initiative.
Disarm
You attack the enemy’s weapon or shield, hoping to make him or her drop it \[Accurate←Strong\]. The attack deals no damage, and if the test fails you expose yourself to a Free Attack from the enemy.
Full Defense
You stake everything on defense and have a second chance to pass all Defense tests during the turn. You are not allowed to perform any attacks.
Full Offense
You stake everything on melee attacks for a turn, giving you a second chance to pass all melee attacks. Because of this you simultaneously have a second chance to fail all Defense test during the turn.
Hold
You attack with a wrestling maneuver aimed at stop- ping the target from moving \[Strong←Strong\]. The trait Robust gives a bonus to the test, +2 at level I, +4 at level II and +8 at level III. This modification applies to both the wrestler and its target, if the latter is Robust. A test is made each turn to maintain the hold. If the test fails, the target gets to make a Free Attack. Also, note that you cannot perform any other actions while maintaining the hold.
Knock Out
You attack from an Advantage, aiming to render the target unconscious. The attack is made as usual, but instead of dealing damage, 1d12 is rolled against the damage value; if the outcome is lower than the value, the target is knocked out. If the attack fails, you lose the Advantage over the target (see page 162 in the Core Rulebook for more on Advantage).
Poison on Weapons
With a passed Cunning test, you may use a combat action to apply poison to your weapon. If the out- come is 20 something goes wrong and you yourself are poisoned. The poison is enough for one hit, then a new dose must be applied.
Push Back
You lunge at the target with the intention of pushing it backwards – out of a room, over the edge of a cliff or similar. You have to start your turn with the push and must spend both your combat and your movement action doing so. A passed attack test deals half damage but will also push the target half a movement back (five meters). If the test fails, the target gets to make a Free Attack.
Tackle
You attack hoping to knock down the target \[Strong←Strong\]. The risk is that you also topple over, whether you make a successful tackle or not; a passed Quick test lets you remain standing. The tackle counts as your combat action and if you are Robust you add +2 to the Strong test per level acquired in the trait.
Take the Initiative
You roll a Resolute test hoping to gain the initiative. If successful you gain a +5 bonus when deciding your place in the order of initiative. The downside is that your speed has a negative impact on your precision; you have a second chance to fail all success test during the turn, no matter if the Resolute test was successful or not. The next turn, you are back to your normal place in the order of initiative.

Damage on Buildings
There will likely be times when the characters are in a hurry to force a physical obstacle, or it may be the enemies who need to do the same in order to reach the characters. New concepts related to buildings are needed: Toughness: When the Toughness of a building reaches zero it is accessible to the attacker: a fortification crumbles, a wall collapses and so on. The breach is big enough for 1d4 attackers to enter per turn, against defenders who can stand four abreast across the newly formed opening. Breakpoint: If a building is dealt half of its Toughness in damage in one turn – i.e. the Breakpoint is exceeded – it is immediately breached. Note that this includes all damage dealt during the turn, not from a single attack as is the case with the Pain Threshold. Hence, with enough catapults gathered, the walls of a castle can be breached in a single turn, at least in theory. Fortification: In essence, Fortification is the Armor of the building. Weapons with the quality Wrecking ignore the Fortification value; other weapons must first penetrate the Fortification value before damaging the structure. Abilities with an armor penetrating effect have no such effect on buildings. Set Buildings on Fire Setting wooden buildings on fire is an often used tactic during sieges. This requires some kind of flammable concoction – it can be an alchemical grenade, a flaming oil canister or a simple fire made from dry twigs and tinder. When the building has been exposed to the flames, a test against \[Cunning –Fortification\] is rolled to see if it catches fire; if so, the flames deal 1d4 damage and count as having the quality Wrecking. Note that whoever lights the fire will become the target of ranged attacks, provided that the building in question has windows or archers on the roof. Those inside a burning building are at risk of suffering damage each turn the building continues to burn – a passed Strong test per turn is Pact-making Beings So, what beings may be interested in forging a pact with the characters? In general, they are creatures of the categories Beasts, Undead or Abominations that provide at least Strong resistance. A couple of perfect examples of such beings appear in the adventures already published by Järnringen, but since this is a player’s guide we cannot specify exactly who they are… 106 required, or else the individual starts taking 1d4 damage (ignoring Armor) each turn from fumes and heat. When a Strong test has failed the damage continues automatically; the only way to stop it is to leave the building or find some other way to cool down. Putting out the fire once it has begun to spread requires access to massive amounts of water, sand or similar. The fire dies when someone succeeds with a test against \[Cunning –the number of turns the fire has raged after the first\]. Anyone who extinguishes the fire in this way will likely become the target of ranged attacks.

Abilities with an armor penetrating effect have no such effect on buildings.

Reclaiming Bolts and Arrows
Some gaming groups may find it realistic and desirable if arrows and bolts which have been fired during combat are at risk of breaking – this makes it important for archers to plan ahead (the projectiles become a resource) and it also makes it worthwhile to spend some time searching for undamaged projectiles after the battle, muttering in anger each time one of them proves to be fractured or destroyed in some other way. Groups who want rules for reclaiming used projectiles can use these guidelines.
* An ordinary projectile proves to be damaged if the player rolls over 10 with 1d20. This applies to all projectiles without qualities.
* A projectile with some kind of quality (e.g. Balanced or Deep Impact) is damaged if the player rolls over 15 with 1d20.
* Projectiles with mystical qualities are damaged if the player rolls over 17 with 1d20.

Hit Locations
This optional rule makes it possible to hit specific parts of the enemy and means that damage equal to or higher than the Pain Threshold has different effects depending on where the enemy is hit. Also, armor may be divided into segments so that the character can have different types of armor on different parts of the body. Aim High or Low The character can choose to aim high or low in order to hit unprotected parts of the target, or to cause a certain effect – for instance that the target loses a movement action or drops something. Aiming high or low gives −2 on the attack test. Aim at Body Part The character can take aim at a specific part of the enemy’s body, hoping to hit a less protected area or achieve a specific effect. Aiming at a specific body part gives –5 on the success test. Armor Segments The character can use different armor on different body parts, to save money and reduce the level of impediment while still protecting the most vital parts as much as possible. Armor segments cost a part of the price of the full armor and have a part of the armor’s value in Impeding. The impediment is rounded up so that 0.5 becomes 1.

Aim High or Low 1D10 HIGH: 1 Right Leg 2 Left Leg 3–4 Torso 5–6 Right Arm 7–8 Left Arm 9–10 Head 1D10 LOW: 1–2 Right Leg 3–4 Left Leg 5–7 Torso 8 Right Arm 9 Left Arm 10 Head

Main Hand If Hit Locations are used, it might be wise to decide if the characters are right- or left-handed. As a suggestion, the character has the same main hand as its player and all NPCs are assumed to be right- handed.
