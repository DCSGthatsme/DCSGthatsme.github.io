## [[Attributes]]
Attributes represent a character's basic aptitudes. The main attributes are Agility, Charisma, Exactitude, Resolve, Might, Subtlety, Vigilance, and Wit. The Toughness, Pain Threshold, Defense, and Corruption Threshold attributes are derived from the main attributes.

Used in a "success test". The test is successful if 1d20 ≤ (tester's attribute score + modifier).

Difficulty Modifier: +5 (very easy) to -5 (very hard)
Opposition Modifier: Based on the relevant attribute score of the opposition. Calculated: 10 - the opposition's attribute score.

| Score | Modifier |
| ----- | -------- |
| 5     | +5       |
| 6     | +4       |
| 7     | +3       |
| 8     | +2       |
| 9     | +1       |
| 10    | 0        |
| 11    | -1       |
| 12    | -2       |
| 13    | -3       |
| 14    | -4       |
| 15    | -5       |
> When a challenge is described in the text of this book it is always written with the character’s Attribute first, like this: \[Character’s Attribute←Modifier\]. When the modification originates from passive resistance, as in the case of a lock, it is instead written \[Character’s Attribute -Modification X\]. Finally, if the test is meant to be performed without any modifications the relevant Attribute is written in plain text with an initial capital letter: Agility.

`[Atr1<-Atr2] read "tester's Atr1 score modified by opposition's Atr2 modifier"`
`[Attribute-Difficulty] read "tester's Attribute score modified by -Difficulty"`

Note that Attributes can be increased via the [[Abilities#Exceptional Attribute|Exceptional Attribute]] Ability.
## [[Abilities]]
Some abilities are gained at character creation. Abilities may be gained or improved using Experience. Traits are abilities that are only gained or improved during character creation, as dictated by race.
* Active Action: The ability is an attack or similar Combat Action. Some of the active abilities generate extra Actions. These extra Actions may not be used to perform an additional active Action, but they benefit from any passive abilities that the character may have.
* Free Action: This Action may be used an unlimited number of times per turn in addition to a character’s usual two Actions, for as long as it is allowed by any conditions specified in the description of the ability.
* Passive Action: The ability does not require a Combat Action to be activated; in other words, the ability is always active. If a character has two or more passive abilities, then they are all considered active at the same time.
* Reaction: The ability is a Reaction to some other Action and therefore doesn’t count against the two Actions a character can perform each turn. Reactive Actions work outside the usual order of Initiative, since a Reaction is performed as a consequence of a triggering Action, regardless of Initiative. Reactions can always make use of passive abilities, but never active ones.
* Special Action: The ability works in a special way, detailed in its description.

> Some abilities can be used “once per adventure.” This can be handled in two ways, depending on what the gaming group prefers. If the characters also have active periods in-between adventures, where they engage in various activities (working, running a business or something like that), these abilities may be rolled during that time frame; some characters spend the down-time in their laboratory, their smithy and so on. If the group is totally committed to continuous adventuring it may be necessary to roll for these abilities at the start of each new adventure, or to find a practical situation during the adventure.
### [[Boons]] 
Minor abilities costing less XP.
### [[Burdens]]
Detrimental abilities that grant an XP cost reduction to an ability, rather than costing XP.
### [[Traits]]
Abilities that are compulsory or optional for certain races.
### [[Mystical Powers]]
Mystical powers are magical abilities. Each mystical power is a variant of the [[Abilities#Mystical Power|Mystical Power]] ability.
### [[Principle Bond]]
Principle Bonds are abilities that are highly suggested for characters who intend to learn and use many Mystical Powers.
### [[Rituals]]
Rituals are magical abilities. Learning rituals requires the [[Abilities#Ritualist|Ritualist]] ability.
## Experience
Experience is awarded by the Game Master. A player can spend experience for new abilities and improved levels for the abilities of the character.

> 1 per scene, but I have my players roll 1d4 as a bonus if they do something really cool or intense. Also, for the big bad boss I give out 1d10 extra xp

`determine when xp may be spent (no existing rule)`

Purchasing a new ability at novice level costs 10 Experience. To increase a novice ability to the adept level costs 20 Experience. To increase an adept ability to the master level costs 30 Experience.

Purchasing a boon costs 5xp. Gaining a burden reduces the cost of a boon or ability by 5xp.

Re-roll for Experience (Optional Rule):
> All rolls can be re-rolled at the cost of one (1) point of Experience, which is permanently spent. Only one re-roll per Action is allowed. This rule increases the chance of survival for the player characters, which can be a good thing, especially if combined with the rules for instant kill and/ or Perfect Hits and Fumbled Defense (see below). In the latter case, the group must agree which rolls can be re-rolled by spending Experience, and which cannot. The group has to decide:
> 	Can you re-roll a Death Test? (Recommendation: No)
> 	Can you re-roll a fumbled Defense? (Recommendation: No)

## [[Go-time]]

Damage & Healing
Damage lowers the victim’s Toughness and an actor dies when its Toughness reaches zero – unless it is a player character, in which case they are regarded as being dying instead. Damage and wounds can be healed in a number of ways, described in this section.

Toughness
The character’s `Max?` Toughness is equal to their Might, but not lower than 10.

Pain Threshold
A character’s Pain Threshold is half of its Might, rounded up. When a creature suffers damage from a single that exceeds its Pain Threshold, one of the following things happens. In the case of a player character taking or inflicting the damage, that player chooses which one happens.
* The affected creature is knocked down and has to get up (see Special Actions).
* The one who deals the damage is allowed to perform an immediate Free Attack against the affected creature.

Dying Characters
Monsters and non-player characters die as soon as their Toughness reaches 0, unless the Game Master wants something else to happen. In any case, the rules for player characters are different.

When a player character reaches 0 Toughness, they collapse and are considered to be dying. At this point, they cannot help themself in any way. Each turn thereafter the player is forced to make a Death Test with 1D20 on the character’s Initiative. This test is repeated until someone else either stabilizes the dying character with an herbal cure, the Medicus ability or mystical healing – or until the player rolls a 1 and wakes up, or a 20 and dies.

Death test (1D20)
1
The character’s damage looked much worse than it actually was; the character wakes up with 1D4 Toughness left. The character can act the next turn.

2–10
The character remains at death’s threshold.

11–19 The character is a step closer to death. The third time the roll has this outcome, the character dies.

20
The character dies, but may say some last harsh words if the player wants to.

Dead Player Characters

Dead player characters cannot remain in the game, but the player may create a new character using all the Experience accumulated by the last character.

Healing Wounds
Healing can happen naturally, by the use of alchemy and medicine or with the help of mystical powers. Performing first aid on a dying person requires the Medicus ability, an herbal cure or powers of healing.
* Natural healing happens at a rate of one (1) point of Toughness per day.
* Alchemical herbal cures heal one (1) point of Toughness immediately.
* The Medicus ability heals 1D4 Toughness, even more when combined with herbal cures.
* Mystical powers, such as Lay on Hands, and the Recovery ability both heal Toughness; see their respective descriptions for details.

Special Actions
The conditions of the combat situation and the weapons of the combatants will affect the course of events. Special rules for line of sight, the use of shields as well as different kinds of advantages are covered in this section.

Note that there are many abilities that affect the character’s capacity to perform Special Actions. For example, an adept in Acrobatics can get up from lying down as a Free Action, provided that he or she succeeds with a Quick test. And the master level of Sixth Sense removes any negative modifications from Blind Fighting – which can be used when attacking opponents in the dark.

Blind Fighting
To fight blinded is hard, and the same goes for fighting under bad lighting conditions such as in darkness, smoke or thick fog. If both parties in a battle are affected, then no adjustments are needed. Otherwise, the affected party gets two chances to fail its success tests – if the character is affected, the player rolls twice and picks the worst result; if only the enemy is affected the player rolls twice and picks the best result.

Disengage From Melee Combat
Disengaging from a melee combat is done on the character’s Initiative and costs a Movement Action. The enemy is allowed a Free Attack against the character. This also applies to situations when the character is facing multiple opponents, in which case each opponent is allowed a Free Attack against the character when he or she chooses to disengage.

Use/Apply Elixir
To use or apply an elixir on either yourself or your equipment counts as a Movement Action. To use or apply it on somebody else counts as a Combat Action.

First Aid
To perform first aid on a wounded person counts as a Combat Action and requires a herbal cure, the Medicus ability or other healing powers. The effect of first aid is described in Damage & Healing.

Stand
Fighting while lying down is possible, but not rec- ommended, because each enemy that has engaged the character in close combat gets an Advantage against a prone character. See rules for Advantage below. If the character makes a successful test against Quick it only takes a Movement Action for the character to get back on its feet. Otherwise, it takes an entire turn, meaning that the character cannot perform a Combat Action while getting up.

Line of Sight
Ranged weapons cannot shoot past other combat- ants, meaning that the shooter (or the mystic) may need to use Movement Actions to maneuver for them to have line of sight. A rule of thumb is that if a shooter or a mystic stands behind an ally so that the targeted enemy is forced to trigger a Free Attack to reach the shooter, then the target is obscured from view by the shooter’s ally.

Shield
Anyone can defend themselves with a shield, pro- viding +1 to Defense. The use of a shield makes it impossible to use ranged and Heavy weapons and neutralizes the reach advantage gained from a Long weapon, since the wielder must use it in one hand. The buckler is an exception to this, allowing the use of both hands, as well as giving the user +1 to Defense.

Flank
To surround the enemy is an effective combat strategy. If two persons flank an enemy, both of them gain an Advantage against the target. A maximum of four persons can surround a person or creature; any combatant beyond that will be unable to reach the target and can only step forward if one of its allies retreats or goes down. Terrain and the movement of the combatant decide what is possible to achieve. Doors, corridors and narrow passages can be used to prevent enemies from flanking. Remember that attempting to move past an enemy triggers a Free Attack. The Free Attack can be avoided if the combatant opts to trade its Combat Action that turn for an additional Movement Action, making it possible to go around the enemy without entering into melee.

Surprised
To sneak up on an enemy or prepare an ambush is an active Action and requires a successful \[Subtlety←Vigilance\] test. Attacking an enemy that is unaware of the incoming attack allows the attacker to make a Free Attack in the first turn of combat. Then the combat follows the usual turn order, based on the combatants Quick.

Advantage
Sometimes one side of a melee combat gets an advantage over the other. A character sneaking up on an enemy to attack it from behind has the Advantage. Another situation where you are at an Advantage is when you attack a target lying on the ground or a target that is climbing towards you. To create advantages when fighting on plain and even ground requires the use of Actions, attacks or movements. If your character has the Advantage in a combat situation, it receives a +2 modification to the relevant Attribute when making a Success test, and its attacks deal 1D4 extra damage. The following situations provide advantages:
* Attacking an enemy that is unaware of the pending attack. For this situation to occur, a successful \[Subtlety←Vigilance\] test is normally required by the attacker.
* All melee attacks against a flanked enemy counts as providing an Advantage. A target is considered flanked if two enemies stand on opposite sides of it. It usually takes a Movement Action to get around an enemy and flank it. In the same way a character can use a Movement Action to get away from a flanked position – but with the consequence of receiving a Free attack from each enemy.
* All melee attacks against an enemy lying down. Note that ranged attacks do not get any advantage from this.
* All attacks against enemies standing on lower ground than the attacker, such as attacking down from a wall against enemies climbing a ladder. This applies to both melee and ranged attacks. Combat Map It can help to have a map of the battle- field in order to get a better overview of the combat situation. Draw the surrounding area on a piece of paper and mark where everybody stands with an “X” or simple markers or tokens. Even objects and terrain – such as trees, boulders and buildings – should be drawn on the map. Then it quickly becomes much more obvious where the combatants stand, who can shoot, who is flanked and so on. A combat map is even more recommended for battles with many combatants, such as in combat situations where the characters face the same number of enemies as themselves.

Problem-solving
Problem-solving refers to situations where your character attempts to achieve something that requires dice rolls and Success tests, but which is not a combat-situation: tracking a fleeing enemy, picking a lock, persuading a guard to let you in or researching the answer to a riddle in a library. The Game Master handles most of this; as a player you only have to be ready to describe how your character attempts to solve the problem, and then roll the dice to make the test asked for by the Game Master.

Social Challenges
Social challenges consist of important negotiations, often involving the great and powerful personas, groups and monsters of the game world – situations that are unfit for combat and cannot be solved with a mere Persuasive test. In short, the social challenge is solved by your and your friends' roleplaying, where you will have to persuade, deceive and bargain your way to a solution. The Game Master handles the parameters for the social challenge, while you portray your character and together with your fellow players try to carry through a successful negotiation around the gaming table. Social challenges are often preceded by scenes of problem-solving, where the character gathers information, secrets and rumors that can be used against the one they need to persuade.
