## [[Attributes]]
Attributes represent a character's basic aptitudes. The main attributes are Agility, Charisma, Exactitude, Resolve, Might, Subtlety, Vigilance, and Wit. Other attributes are derived from the main attributes.

Used in a "success test". The test is successful if 1D20 ≤ (tester's attribute score + modifier).

Difficulty Modifier: +5 (very easy) to -5 (very hard)
Opposition Modifier: Based on the relevant attribute score of the opposition. Calculated: 10 - the opposition's attribute score.

| Score | Modifier |
| ----- | -------- |
| 5     | +5       |
| 6     | +4       |
| 7     | +3       |
| 8     | +2       |
| 9     | +1       |
| 10    | 0        |
| 11    | -1       |
| 12    | -2       |
| 13    | -3       |
| 14    | -4       |
| 15    | -5       |
> When a challenge is described in the text of this book it is always written with the character's Attribute first, like this: \[Character's Attribute←Modifier\]. When the modification originates from passive resistance, as in the case of a lock, it is instead written \[Character's Attribute -Modification X\]. Finally, if the test is meant to be performed without any modifications the relevant Attribute is written in plain text with an initial capital letter: Agility.

`[Atr1<-Atr2] read "tester's Atr1 score modified by opposition's Atr2 modifier"`
`[Attribute-Difficulty] read "tester's Attribute score modified by -Difficulty"`

Note that Attributes can be increased via the [[Abilities#Exceptional Attribute|Exceptional Attribute]] Ability.
