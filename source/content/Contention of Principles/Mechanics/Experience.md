Experience is awarded by the Game Master. A player can spend experience to acquire new [[Abilities]] and to improve their level of mastery.

Every character gets 1D4 Experience at the end of each scene. The Game Master may also reward players with additional Experience for exceptional gameplay moments.

Abilities may be acquired between scenes. However, there will not be any extra time allotted during a play session for browsing the available Abilities. Therefore, if you would like to acquire an Ability mid-session, you should take note of which one(s) you'd like to acquire next.

Typically, acquiring a new Ability at Novice level costs 10 Experience. To increase a Novice Ability to the Adept level costs 20 Experience. To increase an Adept Ability to the Master level costs 30 Experience. However, [[Boons]] cost only 5 Experience and Burdens instead grant an Experience cost reduction.

Most rolls can be re-rolled at the cost of one (1) point of Experience, which is permanently spent. Only one re-roll per Action is allowed.
