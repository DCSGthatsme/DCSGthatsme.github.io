Experience is awarded by the Game Master. A player can spend experience for new abilities and improved levels for the abilities of the character.

> 1 per scene, but I have my players roll 1d4 as a bonus if they do something really cool or intense. Also, for the big bad boss I give out 1d10 extra xp

`determine when xp may be spent (no existing rule)`

Purchasing a new ability at novice level costs 10 Experience. To increase a novice ability to the adept level costs 20 Experience. To increase an adept ability to the master level costs 30 Experience.

Purchasing a boon costs 5xp. Gaining a burden reduces the cost of a boon or ability by 5xp.

Re-roll for Experience (Optional Rule):
> All rolls can be re-rolled at the cost of one (1) point of Experience, which is permanently spent. Only one re-roll per Action is allowed. This rule increases the chance of survival for the player characters, which can be a good thing, especially if combined with the rules for instant kill and/ or Perfect Hits and Fumbled Defense (see below). In the latter case, the group must agree which rolls can be re-rolled by spending Experience, and which cannot. The group has to decide:
> 	Can you re-roll a Death Test? (Recommendation: No)
> 	Can you re-roll a fumbled Defense? (Recommendation: No)
