The distance categories modify damage and the chance to hit, and correspond to the number of movement actions needed for the combatants to engage each other in melee combat. Note that mystical powers are not in any way affected by this rule. An obvious effect of the rule is that characters with ranged weapons cannot fight effectively at short range; they have to move (and suffer Free Attacks) or switch weapons. This means that the abilities [[Acrobatics]], [[Arrow Jab]], and [[Quick Draw]] become even more valuable.

## Fall Damage
A character that falls from a high altitude may suffers damage: 1D6 per Movement Action's distance. A successful \[[[Agility]]\] roll allows the character to land better, or even manage to break the fall. They gain 5 [[Toughness]] for the fall. Water or other soft surfaces provide some cushioning effect as well, granting 5 Toughness as well.
