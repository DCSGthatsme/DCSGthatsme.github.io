When go-time begins, the character with the highest [[Agility]] can choose to either act first or to wait. If two characters have the same Agility value, then compare [[Vigilance]]. If they still share the same value, the GM splits ties.
## Surprise
It usually requires a successful \[[[Subtlety]]←Vigilance\] test to surprise someone or a \[Vigilance←Subtlety\] test to avoid being surprised. If a group tries to surprise another group, instead of individual against individual, use the surpriser's lowest Subtlety modified by the target's highest Vigilance. If a surprise is successful, the surpriser(s) get a Free Attack against the target at the start of Go-time. After that, follow the regular acting order as described above.
## Actions
In Go-time all Actions, except Reactions, are performed on the actor's acting precedence. Primary Actions and Movement Actions are limited. They may either perform one Primary Action and one Movement Action XOR perform two Movement Actions. Additionally, they may perform Free Actions without limit.
### Primary Action
Primary Actions represent the main accomplishment of the turn. Active Abilities use a Primary Action. Passive abilities always act in conjunction with Active ones.
### Movement Action
A Movement Action represents a meaningful motion in go-time. Typically, the exact [[Distance]] is not important. What does matter is if the actor's target is within the range of influence for the action. If a more exact distance needs to be calculated, then a Movement Action represents 10 paces. Movement Actions are used to:
* Reach an enemy and engage it in melee combat
* Take up a flanking position next to an enemy already fighting an ally.
* Move past an enemy to reach another one that stands further away (enemies that are bypassed may perform a Free Attack).
* Withdraw from melee combat (which allows the enemy to perform a Free Attack against the character). If fighting multiple enemies, then each enemy is allowed a Free attack.
* Create a clear line of sight to an obscured enemy. Instead of moving, the Movement Action can be used to perform other kinds of Actions:
* Switch weapons (draw, put away, or both)
* Stand up from a prone position (requires an Agility test).
* Consume/apply an [[Alchemical Substances|Alchemical Substance]] to yourself.
## Combat
When Go-time combat begins, it is important to know whether the actors have their weapons drawn or not.

When an combat encounter suggests a quantity of opponents based on the number of player characters (e.g. \[PC+2\] Robbers), companions such as a [[Familiar]], [[Flaming Servant]], or [[Patron]] should be counted among the characters. This also pertains to longstanding NPCs who are effectively members of the adventuring party, so long as they are equipped to affect the outcome of the fight.

In go-time combat, each attack is a Primary Action. The attack is made with \[[[Exactitude]]←[[Defense]]\]. Note that some abilities can allow you to attack using other Attributes besides Exactitude, and calculate Defense using something else than Agility.

If any of the combatants are surprised at the start of combat, they must draw their weapons. All Short weapons can be readied as a Free Action. To ready a weapon is otherwise considered a Movement Action. Another option is of course to not draw any weapons and instead choose to use unarmed attacks; an individual's or creature's natural weapons are always considered ready.
### Reaction
Reactions are quick responses or follow-ups to other Actions or circumstances. They can be performed in any moment during go-time. The character can perform as many Reactions as is called for per turn, as long as there are triggers to react to. Reactions can use the effect of passive abilities, but not of active ones.
### Free Actions
There are situations when your character will have the opportunity to make a Free attack with their weapon. This most commonly happens when the character is armed with a Long weapon, when an enemy tries to flee from an ongoing melee combat or when an opponent tries to run past the character in order to reach someone or something behind it. There are also some abilities which trigger Free Attacks under special circumstances. Free attacks can use the effect of passive abilities but not of active ones, and normally the character can only gain one Free Attack per triggering factor and turn – if two enemies try to withdraw from melee only 1 Free Attack is gained, but if one withdraws and one runs past, the character gains one Free Attack on each.
