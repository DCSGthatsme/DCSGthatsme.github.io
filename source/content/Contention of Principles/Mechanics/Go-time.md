When go-time begins, the character with the highest [[Agility]] can choose to either act first or to wait. You may choose to put your acting precedence later, but once the acting order is established it cannot be changed. If two characters have the same Agility value, then compare [[Vigilance]]. If they still share the same value, the GM splits ties.

## Combat
When go-time combat begins, it is important to know whether the actors have their weapons drawn or not. Also, remember that Long weapons get a Free Attack against one enemy during the first `turn? round?` of melee go-time, provided that the enemy does not have a Long weapon as well.

When an combat encounter suggests a quantity of opponents based on the number of player characters (e.g. \[PC+2\] Robbers), companions such as a [[Familiar]], [[Flaming Servant]], or [[Patron]] should be counted among the characters. This also pertains to longstanding NPCs who are effectively members of the adventuring party, so long as they are equipped to affect the outcome of the fight.

## Surprise
It usually requires a successful \[Subtlety←Vigilance\] test to surprise someone. If a group tries to surprise another group, instead of individual against individual, use the attackers' lowest Subtlety modified by the defenders' highest Vigilance. They who surprises an enemy is allowed to make one Free Attack against the enemy at the start of the turn. After that, follow the regular acting order, based on the actors' Agility values, as described above. If any of the combatants are surprised at the start of combat, they must draw their weapons. All Short weapons can be unsheathed as a Free Action. To unsheathe a weapon is otherwise considered a Movement Action. Another option is of course to not draw any weapons and instead choose to use unarmed attacks; an individual's or creature's natural weapons are always considered ready.

## Actions
In go-time all Actions, except Reactions, are performed on the actor's acting precedence. Primary Actions and Movement Actions are limited. They may either perform one Primary Action and one Movement Action XOR perform two Movement Actions. Additionally, they may perform Free Actions without limit.
### Primary Action
Any active ability can be used as a Primary Action. A Primary Action can be replaced with an additional Movement Action, but a Movement Action cannot be replaced with an additional Primary Action.

Passive abilities always act together with active ones.

In go-time combat, each attack is a Primary Action. The attack is made with \[Exactitude←Defense\]. Note that some abilities can allow you to attack using other Attributes besides Exactitude, and calculate Defense using something else than Agility.
### Movement Action
A Movement Action represents a meaningful motion in go-time. Typically, the exact distance is not important. What does matter is if the actor's target is within the range of influence for the action. If a more exact distance needs to be calculated, then a Movement Action represents 10 paces. Movement Actions are used to:
* Reach an enemy and engage it in melee combat.
* Take up a flanking position next to an enemy already fighting an ally.
* Move past an enemy to reach another one that stands further away (enemies that are bypassed may perform a Free Attack).
* Withdraw from melee combat (which allows the enemy to perform a Free Attack against the character). If fighting multiple enemies, then each enemy is allowed a Free attack.
* Create a clear line of sight to an obscured enemy. Instead of moving, the Movement Action can be used to perform other kinds of Actions:
* Switch weapons (draw, put away, or both)
* Stand up from a prone position (requires an Agility test).
* Drink/apply an elixir to yourself.
### Distance Categories
If your gaming group wants more nuanced and tactically relevant rules, the following guidelines may be used: Each combat encounter starts at a distance determined by the situation and terrain (the GM decides). The distance categories modify damage and the chance to hit, and correspond to the number of movement actions needed for the combatants to engage each other in melee combat. Note that mystical powers are not in any way affected by this rule. An obvious effect of the rule is that characters with ranged weapons cannot fight effectively at short range; they have to move (and suffer Free Attacks) or switch weapons. This means that the abilities Acrobatics, Arrow Jab and Quick Draw become even more valuable.

| Distance Category | Effect on Ranged Weapons                                                             | Approx. Distance | Number of Movements |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Close             | Attack is only possible in the first turn and only if the shooter has the initiative | 1-2 meters       | None                |
| Short             | +2 on attack test, +1D4 in damage                                                    | 10 meters        | 1                   |
| Medium            | None                                                                                 | 20 meters        | 2                   |
| Long              | -2 on attack test                                                                   | 50 meters        | 5                   |
| Extreme           | -5 on attack test                                                                   | 100 meters       | 10                  |
### Reaction
Reactions are quick responses or follow-ups to other Actions or circumstances. They can be performed in any moment during go-time. The character can perform as many Reactions as is called for per turn, as long as there are triggers to react to. Reactions can use the effect of passive abilities, but not of active ones.
### Free Actions
There are situations when your character will have the opportunity to make a Free attack with their weapon. This most commonly happens when the character is armed with a Long weapon, when an enemy tries to flee from an ongoing melee combat or when an opponent tries to run past the character in order to reach someone or something behind it. There are also some abilities which trigger Free Attacks under special circumstances. Free attacks can use the effect of passive abilities but not of active ones, and normally the character can only gain one Free Attack per triggering factor and turn – if two enemies try to withdraw from melee only 1 Free Attack is gained, but if one withdraws and one runs past, the character gains one Free Attack on each.
