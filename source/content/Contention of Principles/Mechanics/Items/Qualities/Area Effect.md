## Effect
The weapon affects all inside its area. One test is made for each creature in the area; those who are fail suffer full damage while those who pass the [[Defense]] test suffer half damage. Ongoing secondary effects only affect those who suffer full damage from the initial effect.

There are two types of Area Effects, radius and cone. The radius effects all creatures within a certain [[Distance]] from the weapon. For a cone, anyone present in front of the weapon is at risk of being hit when the weapon is fired. The cone is as wide as the distance from the weapon.
