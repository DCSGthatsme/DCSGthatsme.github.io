## Effect
The weapon has the advantage of superior length and reach, giving the wielder one Free Attack each round against an opponent that comes into range of melee combat, as long as said opponent is not also armed with a Long weapon. Additionally, Long weapons get a Free Attack against one enemy during the first round of melee go-time, provided that the enemy does not have a Long weapon as well.
