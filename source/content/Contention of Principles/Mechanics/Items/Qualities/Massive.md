## Effect
The weapon makes other weapons look puny in comparison. The wielder has a second chance at the damage test; the damage die is rolled twice and the higher of the two outcomes is used. Note that this only applies to the damage die of the weapon, not of additional dice from [[Abilities]], [[Mystical Powers]], and [[Alchemical Elixirs]].

If a Massive weapon is used against a player character, the player instead rolls for [[Toughness]] twice and the lowest total determines the level of protection.
