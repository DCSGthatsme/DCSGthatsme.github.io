## Effect
The weapon is flexible, letting parts of the weapon strike past or around blocking weapons or shields, making it harder to parry. Its length also makes the attacks difficult to evade. Even if a parry is successful, the attack hits if the die lands on an odd number; in which case the weapon deals 1D6 damage. This secondary damage is not affected by any abilities â€“ it remains 1D6 regardless of the attacker's other abilities.
## Notes
* Originally "Jointed".
* "Flexible" was originally an armor quality that reduced Impedance by 2. It has been baked into the armors' stats instead of being tracked as a quality.
