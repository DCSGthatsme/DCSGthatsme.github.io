## Effect
The item normally goes unnoticed, or is seen as something else than a protection or a weapon. If someone actively examines the owner/carrier, a test against \[[[Subtlety]]←[[Vigilance]]\] is rolled, otherwise it cannot be discovered. Other hidden items can be discovered at first glance with such a test.
