## Effect
The weapon can be wielded in one or two hands, even if it only comes into its own when both hands are used. The weapon loses one or all of its qualities when used single-handed, but can instead be combined with a shield, which may be preferable at times. Another upside is that it can be used while mounted, wielded in one hand until the rider dismounts and can grip it in two.
