## Effect
Moderate<br>Imbues any object larger than a fist
The artificer specifies a trigger criterion. Such a criterion can, for instance, be that a living creature enters the room, that someone steps on the artifact, or that a weapon is drawn in the vicinity. The artificer can exclude themself from being able to trigger the artifact, but their allies cannot be excluded â€“ if they meet the criterion, the power is activated. The artificer does not have to know the power which is to be trapped, but in that case they need the assistance of a mystic who does. The Spell Trap can be dispelled with [[Anathema]] or the ritual [[Break Link]].
