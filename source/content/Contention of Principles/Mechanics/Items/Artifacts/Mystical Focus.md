## Effect
Strong<br>Imbues any item<br>A Crux-specific focus gives a +1 bonus on all tests related to all Mystical Powers of a certain Crux while the focus is equipped or worn, but limited to one use per scene. The bonus may be used together with other artifacts that also provide a bonus to success tests for the mystical power in question. A mystical focus is bound to the user as other, higher artifacts â€“ that is, by spending an experience point or by willingly accepting one point in Permanent [[Corruption]].
