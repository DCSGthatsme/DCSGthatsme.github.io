With a passed [[Wit]] test, the character can use a Primary Action to deploy a trap.

Anyone at risk of activating a trap discovers it with a passed \[[[Vigilance]]←[[Subtlety]]\] test.

A discovered trap can be bypassed in two ways: It can be jumped over as part of a Movement Action, which requires an \[[[Agility]]←[[Wit]]\] test. If the test fails, the trap is sprung and the character is caught by it, i.e. movement is interrupted. If the terrain allows, a trap can always be ignored by going around it. This costs an extra Movement Action, or more depending on the terrain.

A discovered trap can also be disarmed. An untrained individual cannot disarm traps – they have to incapacitate them by shooting or poking at them with a [[Long]] instrument. The procedure counts as a Primary Action and requires a passed \[[[Exactitude]]←Wit\] test.
