## Effect
[[Volatile]] (Novice [[Trapper]] or \[19\])

Mechanical traps come in many designs, but the basic version consists of two jagged semi-circles that slam shut when triggered. A passed [Strong←Cunning] test is required to get free, the latter being the trap-makers attribute value (the average trap-maker can be assumed to have Cunning 13 (–3)). Each attempt to break free counts as a combat action.

Weak<br>The trap deals 1d8 damage.

Moderate<br>The trap deals 1d10 damage.

Strong<br>The trap deals 1d12 damage.
