When the alchemist brews the elixir, they choose one of the following Monstrous Features for their draught to confer: [[Armored]], [[Natural Weapon]], [[Robust]], or [[Wings]].

# Wild Chew
`APG`
Weak<br>The red chewing resin called Wild Chew is a strong stimulant that makes the chewer more alert, less cautious and much more aggressive. One dose of Wild Chew moves 2 points in Subtlety, Wit, and Resolve to Agility, Might and Exactitude for the rest of the scene. During the upcoming scene, the user feels weak and has -2 on all attributes. With time, Wild Chew is highly addictive and severe withdrawal symptoms will occur unless the user consumes one dose each week, with the risk of permanent madness or death. No known drugs can counteract this.
# Wraith Dust
Strong<br>The wraith dust forces an incorporeal being (a creature with the [[Spirit Form]] [[Monstrous Features|Monstrous Feature]]) to take physical form for the duration of a scene. The dust must be thrown with a \[[[Exactitude]]←[[Defense]]\] test; if hit the spirit takes damage as living creatures do.
