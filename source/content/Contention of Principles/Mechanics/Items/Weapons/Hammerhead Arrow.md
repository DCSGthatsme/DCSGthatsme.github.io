## Effect
[[Primed]], [[Short]], [[Single-handed]]<br>1D8 damage when fired from a bow, 1D6 damage otherwise

The ball-shaped head of this arrow is meant to stun, rather than damage, the target. After a successful hit, damage is rolled as usual, but the outcome is used to decide if the target is stunned \[[[Might]] â€“Damage\]. If the target is stunned, they may not perform any actions on their following turn.
