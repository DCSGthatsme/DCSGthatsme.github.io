## Effect
[[Two-handed]], [[Flexible]], [[Massive]], [[Unwieldy]]<br>1D10 damage

The heavy flail is a larger version of the battle flail. As might be expected, the heavier flail is slower but has a greater impact on the unfortunates who are hit by its massive head.
## Notes
* From the Symbaroum Advanced Player's Guide. The Advanced Player's Guide renamed the original "Heavy Fail"  to [[Battle Flail]].
