[[Single-handed]], [[Short]], [[Thrown]]<br>0 damage when thrown, 1D4 damage otherwise

Up to 4 may be thrown as one attack. Each bagakay thrown either gives +1 to the attack test or +1 damage (to be determined after the success test die is rolled).

On a successful melee attack roll, the bagakay is broken if the die landed on an odd number.
