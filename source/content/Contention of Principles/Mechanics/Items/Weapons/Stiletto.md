`APG, previously "Assassin's Blade" where previously Stiletto has been renamed "Karambit"`
[[Single-handed]], [[Short]], [[Concealed]]<br>1d6 damage

The agile stiletto is a dagger whose razor sharp point stabs deeply and is easy to conceal without - the perfect weapon for an assassin. It is easily strapped to the wrist or ankle, or even attached behind the neck with a lump of resin. Special girdles or hidden pockets in clothes work just as well.
