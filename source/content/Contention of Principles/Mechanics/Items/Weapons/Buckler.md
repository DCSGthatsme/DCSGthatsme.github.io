[[Single-handed]], [[Primed]], [[Short]], [[Unarmed]]<br>1d4 damage, +1 Defense

The buckler is a small shield commonly carried by elite archers and pikemen, since it is agile enough to be strapped to the arm while still allowing the use of both hands to wield a weapon. The Buckler is too light to be used with the [[Shield Fighter]] skill.
