[[Versatile]], [[Precise]] (two-handed)<br>1d10 damage (two-handed), 1d8 damage (single-handed)

The weapon is preferably handled with both hands but can also be used single-handedly with a shield. When wielded with just one hand, the bastard sword loses the Precise quality and instead deals damage like a single-handed weapon.
