## Effect
Weak<br>A sticky paste which emits nearly-transparent fumes when burned that make living creatures glow softly, making it harder to stay hidden in the dark (a second chance to fail tests for sneaking up on someone, or a second chance to pass tests to discover someone sneaking) and making invisibility impossible. This affects every being in the room or the vicinity.
