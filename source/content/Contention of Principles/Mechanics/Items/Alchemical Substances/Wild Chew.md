## Effect
Weak<br>A gum that acts as a stimulant to the one who chews it. They become more alert, less cautious, and much more aggressive. One dose of Wild Chew moves 2 points from each of [[Subtlety]], [[Wit]], and [[Resolve]] into [[Agility]], [[Might]], and [[Exactitude]] for the rest of the scene. For the subsequent scene, the user feels weak and has -2 on all [[Attributes]]. With time, Wild Chew is highly addictive and severe withdrawal symptoms will occur unless the user consumes one dose each week, with the risk of permanent madness or death. No known drugs can counteract this.
