## Effect
A sticky paste which emits nearly scentless poisonous fumes when burned. To recognize the toxin over regular smoke requires a successful \[[[Vigilance]]‚Üê[[Subtlety]]\] test. The poison is airborne and affects everyone in the room or in the vicinity. It must burn for 1d4 rounds before the poison takes hold, so an assassin could light it and leave the room before it takes effect.

Moderate<br>Deals 2 damage per round.

Strong<br>Deals 3 damage per round.
