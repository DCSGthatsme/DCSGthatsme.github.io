## Effect
Moderate<br>Sleep Syrup is a liquid made from drone spores, also containing accelerants. A person who ingests a dose immediately falls asleep if they do not pass a Might test, and stays asleep for an hour or until suffering any damage. If the test is passed, the person is instead dazed, with the effect that they are limited to one action on their turns and cannot use any active abilities for an hour.
