## Effect
A sticky, woody paste that works to counteract all poisons when ingested.

Weak<br>Lowers the effect of a poison by one degree; a Strong poison becomes Moderate, a Moderate poison becomes Weak, and a Weak poison is completely neutralized. The antidote does not affect any damage that a character has already suffered. Requires a passed [[Wit]] test to take effect.

Moderate<br>As Weak, but lowers the effect of a poison by two degrees.

Strong<br>As Moderate, but lowers the effect of a poison by three degrees.
