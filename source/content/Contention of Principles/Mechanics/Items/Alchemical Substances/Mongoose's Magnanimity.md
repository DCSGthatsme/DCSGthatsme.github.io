## Effect
A sticky paste which emits medicinal fumes when burned that work as an antidote on all around it.

Moderate<br>Affects every poisoned creature in the vicinity and reduces the effect of ongoing poisons by one level â€“ a strong poison becomes moderate, a moderate weak and a weak is neutralized.

Strong<br>Does the same, but with a two level reduction: a strong poison becomes weak while moderate and weak ones are neutralized. Note that this does not affect damage already suffered.
