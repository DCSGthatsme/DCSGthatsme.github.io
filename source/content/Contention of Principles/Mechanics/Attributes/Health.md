Maximum Health is equal to [[Might]] or is equal to 10 if Might is less than 10.

Health begins at the Maximum Health and is reduced by damage. The character becomes Powerless when their Health reaches zero.

In most cases, non-player characters die upon becoming Powerless.

When a player character becomes Powerless, they fall prone and may be considered to be dying. While Powerless, they cannot perform any actions. On each of the character's turns thereafter, the player must make the following test. Roll 1D20. If you roll:
* 1
	* The character's damage looked much worse than it actually was; the character leaves the Powerless state with 1D4 Health. The character can act the next round.
* 2–10
	* The character remains Powerless.
* 11–19
	- The character is a step closer to Tragedy. The third time the roll has this outcome, the a Tragedy befalls the character.
- 20
	- A Tragedy befalls the character.
 This test is repeated unless another character intervenes in some way (i.e. an herbal cure, the [[Medic]] ability, or mystical healing).

The Tragedy may simply be death, or it may be some other extreme outcome depending on the situation.
## Notes
* Originally "Toughness", which is now [[Health]].
