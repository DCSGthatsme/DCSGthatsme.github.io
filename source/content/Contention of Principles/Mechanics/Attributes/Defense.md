Defense is equal to [[Agility]] - [[Impeding]].

As a Reaction, a character may attempt to defend themself against any attacks of which they are aware. When a character is attacked, their defense is tested as \[Defense←[[Exactitude]]\]. If the test is successful, the character has avoided the attack.
