Pain Threshold is equal to [[Might]]/2, rounded up. When a creature suffers damage that exceeds their Pain Threshold in a single instance (after considering [[Defense]] and [[Protection]]), one of the following things happens. In the case of a player character taking or inflicting the damage, that player chooses which one happens.
* The affected creature is knocked prone.
* The one who deals the damage is allowed to perform an immediate Free Attack against the affected creature.
