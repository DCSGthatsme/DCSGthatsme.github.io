Attributes are the core determining factor in a character's success when they face challenges. They are tracked as numerical values, typically from 0 to 20. Attributes tend not to change dramatically, but they can generally be improved.
## Primary Attributes
The primary Attributes form the foundation for a character's aptitudes. Whenever a player character attempts to perform an action, the player may be required to make a success test. In the absence of any modifiers, the action is successful if the character's Attribute is greater than or equal to the value rolled on a d20. Therefore, the greater a value the character has in a certain Attribute, the more likely they are to succeed when undertaking challenges which benefit from such an aptitude.
