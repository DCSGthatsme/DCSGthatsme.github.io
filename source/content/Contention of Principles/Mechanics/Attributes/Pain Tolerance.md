## Effect
Pain Tolerance is equal to [[Might]]/2, rounded up.

When a character suffers more damage in a single instance (after considering [[Defense]] and [[Toughness]]) than their Pain Tolerance, one of the following things happens. In the case of a player character taking or inflicting the damage, that player chooses which one happens.
* The affected character is knocked prone.
* The one who deals the damage is allowed to perform an immediate Free Attack against the affected character.
## Notes
* Originally "Pain Threshold".
