## Example
* Character concept
	* A miner whose plain ignorance prevents them from seeing their contributions to the world's evils
* Aspirations
	* They want to make money; enough to live securely. They spend much of their off time with hobbyist carving and smithing, making decorations and trinkets.
* Meddlements
	* As a miner working under of an expansive and intrusive mining company, they are ultimately partially responsible for the company's immoral acts.
* Flaws
	* They are prone to drinking and over-drinking, believing and admitting only to the former. They are ignorant, which is plain to see from their coworkers and family alike; they do not tend to care about the things that do not directly affect them. They are also uncharitable; they wouldn't willingly give anything material of theirs to anyone, regardless of their need, which does help them ignore the hardship that surrounds them.
	* (Part of the polish stage) Their drinking puts results them in compromising situations, impeding their aspiration to live securely due to dangerous social interactions and its effect on their work. Additionally, it can eat into their hobby time which is essential for their mental/emotional balance. Their drinking, ignorance, and uncharitability all impede their ability to create the emotional bonds they want.
* Virtues
	* They are hard-working. They are loyal when it comes to emotional bonds. They are also creative and resourceful.
* Motivations
	* Ultimately, they are driven by their desire to live easily. Their ignorance and uncharitability bring them further to the mistrust and demonization of all others with every passing day, further justifying the need and strengthening the desire to live comfortably and separately from the world.
* Knives
	* They fear becoming disabled. They value their hands and mind as their only tools with which they can express their creativity and earn their wage.
	* Their contract with the mining company is somewhat damning.
	* Their home and possessions
	* Their mother
* Breaking points
	* The worst thing they have done, by their own moral standards, is leaving others to die while they saved themself in a cave-in. By my moral standards, the worst things they have done have been particularly bad bouts of lying and insistence in drunken attempts at seduction.
	* They would sell out their family. Not to their deaths, but to a degree of worse life. They would do it for great money or a great guarantee of comfort or safety.
	* The most traumatic thing was also the cave-in.
	* Those who are both poor *and* lazy incite cynicism in them.
	* They wouldn't mind being forgotten, but they wouldn't want to be remembered as "just another dirty miner."
	* The extent of their contact with principles have been sightings. They would have little tolerance for principles affecting their life in any measurable way.
