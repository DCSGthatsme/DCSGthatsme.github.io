## Philosophy
* Only humans as the sapient species
* Principles as the primary source of conflict and metaphysics
* Fantasy with low magic, wild and dangerous, with standout extreme moments
* Sophistry:
	* Inherent corruption
	* Non-institutional
	* No explicit "soul" magic
	* No necromancy, no afterlife
	* No "holy" magic
	* Inherently shameful
	* Will and a tolerance for adversity as the measure of a Sophist's power
	* Beings as magic begetters, not objects or places
* Gritty tone with survival as a constant struggle
* Current time is the world's peak; no advanced precursor civilization
* Humanity unified in goal and language, divided in location and culture
* Freedom in character creation; no classes, no inherent characteristics
* Trade & barter economies

## Overarching Changes
### World
Symbaroum's world of Ambria and Davokar and the accompanying lore has been fully replaced. However, the theming and mechanics of Symbaroum have surely influenced Contention of Principles in subtle ways.
### Race
Symbaroum featured several playable races in addition to humans: changelings, ogres, goblins, elves, abducted humans, dwarves, trolls and undead. These races have been cut.
### Archetype
Symbaroum has archetypes instead of classes as ignorable suggestions for effective kinds of characters. The Advanced Player's Guide adds professions, which impose mechanical differences between archetypes, making them a soft class system. Professions have been cut to maintain a fully classless system.
### Shadows
Symbaroum has shadows as a kind of mystical fingerprint for all beings and objects with some mechanical significance. This idea has been cut.
### Corruption
Corruption in Symbaroum is conceptualized as a kind of blight. In many ways, it is living and infectious and not necessarily tied to acts of magic. This idea has been reworked to explicitly be a consequence of human magic (Sophistry) and instances of Corruption transfer, growth, and abatement have been kept to a minimum.

Stigmas have been reworked from a punishment for one's Corruption surpassing a certain threshold to a punishment inflicted when a great amount of Corruption is incurred at once. Additionally, Stigmas are no longer automatically healed with the removal of Corruption.
### Mystical Traditions
Mystical Traditions have been reworked as [[Principle Bonds]].
### Monsters
