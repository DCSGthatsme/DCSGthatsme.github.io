Welcome to **Contention of Principles**. In this fantasy setting, humanity is neither unified nor predominant. Instead, they cling to survival as scattered tribes occupying mere villages and hamlets. Human existence is palpably shadowed by the **Principles**, supernatural beings of world-shaping influence. "Spirits", "beasts", and "deities" are words that may evoke an approximate notion of their natures. Their appearances, abilities, and temperaments are varied, but some things are certain. They roam the **wild**. They are **powerful**. They are **capricious**.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

Opinions on the Principles are as diverse as the tribes they affect. While most view them with bitter **hate** or resigned **apathy**, it is common belief that the isolationist tribes practice reverence or outright submission. The primary strategy for surviving in a world of Principle cohabitation is simple **avoidance** - settling in regions that are remote, innately absent of Principles, or prohibitory to Principles in some way. Some tribes are only secure in their territory through the recompense of martial ferocity.

The **setting** may be termed low fantasy, for the magic and supernatural is most often deemed an intrusion upon ordinary life. What "ordinary life" is to each tribe is varied. In some places with certain cultures, daily life is characterized by struggle, loss, and the thrum of blood that comes with toil and confrontation. To others, daily life for a tribe may be rustic, pastoral, and even charming on good days. Both are opposing extremes; most tribes experience life somewhere in-between.

The setting explores **themes** of environmental stewardship, the conflicts between tradition and change, and humanity's struggle to find meaning and purpose amid chaos and futility. The narrative will also explore various other themes of universal relatability.

The **tone** is fairly dark. Optimism is a hard-fought boon. Violence and tragedy are present, meaningful, and always accompanied by consequence. Just to be clear, even though the world may be ruthless and severe at times, it is **NOT** a grimdark carnival of misery and despair. The intention is to represent misfortune as non-trivial, where each occurrence is steeped in meaning without gratuitously indulging in negativity.

We will discuss personal **boundaries** both privately and in our zeroth session to ensure that the game is a safe space to explore these themes and tones.

**Players** will play **characters** that are unlike the heroes of other RPGs in many ways. They will be complex people marked by personal flaws. [[Character Creation|Character creation]] will be guided during our zeroth session. Besides fitting with the world, the themes, and the tone, character creation will be a highly personalizable activity. Players will not be expected to be "good" with game mechanics in order to succeed; I aim to be cooperative while rules are being learned and sympathetic to misunderstandings stemming from the rules. Players will not be expected to perform at the table as an actor or professional entertainer would. As a game that is more serious in tone, I would only ask you inhabit your role to your utmost as I do my best to  facilitate an environment that makes doing so easy and fun.

The **narrative** begins with a desperate summons from a village chieftain requesting aid against a looming Principle threat. The narrative will continue along a determined throughline, forming the backbone of the game.Â The **story** - the collection of unique moments your characters bring into the world - is the true heart of the game. Such things cannot bloom until the game begins, nor can I prepare to support you players in your story until your characters have been made! So while I may be willing to vaguely answer regarding aspects of the narrative, know that I cannot speak on behalf of your story.

We will use a modified version of **Symbaroum** as a mechanics system. It's a straightforward roll-under d20 system. You will not be expected to have prior rules knowledge or to bring or purchase your any materials. You are welcome to bring a set of dice for your own use (d4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20) or any spare sets you'd like to share. The Principles and the setting are inspired by Princess Mononoke, Astrea: Six-Sided Oracles, and various folklores.
